<div><p><a id="Agincourt"><h2 class="song">Agincourt</h2></a>
(lyrics by Lisa Theriot, music by Ken and Lisa Theriot)</p> 
<p>I left my home to take the coin<br>
King Henry's army for to join<br>
A knightly fee I seek to hold<br>
A belt to wear, and spurs of gold</p>
 
<p>Two accolades had King Henry<br>
Just one would be enough for me<br>
So off we march from keep and town<br>
To win my King a second crown</p>
 
<p><em>For God, Saint George, and King Henry<br>
I've brought my men across the sea<br>
Honor and right we're fighting for<br>
I'll win my spurs at Agincourt!</em></p>
 
<p>I brought in train nine armored men<br>
And bowmen steady, ten by ten<br>
We've taken ship and come to land<br>
On Normandy's green earth we stand</p>
 
<p>A hundred years of war we've known<br>
Our King denied his second throne<br>
We'll beard the lion in his den<br>
And show the worth of English men!</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>
 
<p>To Harfleur Town we laid the siege<br>
And little could I serve my liege<br>
My men are sick, the rivers swell<br>
How long must we bide here in Hell?</p>
 
<p>Then Holland's men essay the gate<br>
defended bravely, but too late<br>
Our guns are brought to breach the walls<br>
And by surrender Harfleur falls.</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>King Henry stands in armor clad<br>
And though we fear, our hearts are glad<br>
He calls us brothers, happy few<br>
I may die my liege, but I'll not shame you!</p>
 
<p>At last the French are camped in sight<br>
With battle planned for morning's light<br>
The minstrels sing with all their breath<br>
The priests prepare our souls for death</p>

<p>But defeat I cannot reckon by<br>
A prisoner I, my men to die?<br>
I've asked forgiveness from the Lord<br>
So take my soul and bring my sword!</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>The Duke of York my men will guard<br>
My bowmen in the archers' yard<br>
No man may make it back alive<br>
For each we have, the French have five</p>

<p>The battle's joined, the arrows fly<br>
The French on horse attack hard by<br>
A mighty press, the Duke is down<br>
What price to pay for Henry's crown?</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>What miracle my eyes have spied<br>
Our valiant archers turn the tide<br>
Before them each a sharpened stave<br>
From charging horse their life to save</p>

<p>The charge falls back on their own ranks<br>
With arrows in their horses' flanks<br>
The wounded mounts run mad with pain<br>
The French line breaks, their plans in vain</p>

<p>By English might the French are pressed<br>
King Henry fights like one possessed<br>
The Duke will never rise again<br>
It falls to me to lead our men</p>

<p>Will rallied cry our van attacks<br>
The archers join with sword and axe<br>
With banners high we meet the fray<br>
Against all odds we win the day!</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>To London Town and songs of praise<br>
In victory we proudly raise<br>
The banner of Saint George's cross<br>
To cries of, "Deo Gratias"</p>

<p>But now I ride for my own lands<br>
To serve the King as he commands<br>
To keep the faith he placed in me<br>
With grace and might of chivalry</p>

<p><em>For God, Saint George, and King Henry<br>
We gained a mighty victory<br>
And I return, a squire no more<br>
I won my spurs at Agincourt!</em></p>

<div><p><a id="All-Among-the-Barley"><h2 class="song">All Among the Barley</h2></a></p>

<p>Now is come September, the hunter's moon begun<br>
And through the wheaten stubble, we turn the green to dun<br>
The leaves are pale and yellow, and are kindling into red<br>
And the ripe and bearded barley is hanging down its head</p>

<p><em>All among the barley, who would not be blithe<br>
When the ripe and bearded barley is smiling on the scythe</em></p>

<p>The spring is like a young man who does not know his mind<br>
The summer is a tyrant of most ungracious kind<br>
The autumn's like an old friend, who helps where e'er she can<br>
For she brings the bearded barley to gladden the hearts of man</p>
<p><em>Chorus</em></p>
<p>The wheat is like a rich man, it's sleek and well-to-do<br>
The oats are like a pack of girls, laughing and dancing too<br>
The rye is like a miser, it's sulky, lean, and small<br>
And the ripe and bearded barley is monarch of them all</p>

<p><em>Chorus (x2)</em></p>

<p>Am       C        G       Am<br>
Sleep my love and peace attend thee<br>
Em              Am<br>

Am   C      G     Am<br>
I my loving vigil keeping<br>
Em              Am<br>
<em>All through the night</em></p>

<p>No forebodings should alarm thee<br>
<em>All through the night</em><br>
I will let no peril harm thee<br>

Though the dark moves ever toward thee<br>
From such danger do I ward thee<br>
Peace and rest may sleep afford thee<br>
<em>All through the night</em></p>

<p>Moon and stars the dark adorning<br>
<em>All through the night</em><br>
Marching ever towards the morning<br>
<em>All through the night</em><br>
Deep the silence 'round us spreading<br>
Dark the path that thou art treading<br>
I tomorrow's sunrise dreading<br>
<em>All through the night</em></p>

<p>Hark, a solemn bell is ringing<br>
<em>All through the night</em><br>
Loud and clear the clapper swinging<br>
<em>All through the night</em><br>
Soul immortal thou shall waken<br>
Earthly dust from off thee shaken<br>
From the living thou art taken<br>
<em>All through the night</em></p>

<p>Though from sleep I cannot wake thee<br>
<em>All through the night</em><br>
Know that I will not forsake thee<br>
<em>All through the night</em><br>
Love and light alike are sleeping<br>
From my eyes the tears are seeping<br>
Silent I sit by thee weeping<br>

All for thee my heart is yearning<br>

(by Lucien de Pontivy mka Myra Hope Eskridge)</p>

<p>On these hard-beaten walls<br>
You are patient to wait<br>
I've come hundreds of miles<br>
To arrive at your gate<br>
In a nation of warriors<br>
They call you the Great<br>
If you give me your word I will stay</p>

<p>I've brought ten hundred men<br>
Who will die at my call<br>
But they've families too,<br>
Who will fight, kill, and fall<br>
It's their lives and a future<br>
I want for them all<br>
If you give me your word I will stay</p>

<p>Fly south, to the great Towy Valley<br>
Then ride west of the snowy Black Mountains<br>
And you'll find the land of my fathers<br>
And mothers of old</p>

<p>My home to the north is Ceredigion<br>
It's a well-guarded land<br>
With high cliffs to watch on<br>
In the evening the sea<br>
Turns to gold in the sun<br>
If you give me your word I will stay</p>

<p>You've a hand rough from fighting<br>
And arm for a shield<br>
But my valleys are soft<br>
With green meadows and fields<br>
It's a fine, fertile land<br>
And it's yours if I yield<br>
If you give me your word I will stay</p>

<p>Fly south, to the great Towy Valley<br>
Then ride west of the snowy Black Mountains<br>
And you'll find the land of my fathers<br>
And mothers of old
And a king and a castle alone in the cold</p>

<p>Rise up from your knees, Lord<br>
Bring gold from the green<br>
Such magnificent tribute<br>
I have never seen<br>
You're courageous and strong<br>
A man fit for a queen<br>
By my heart and my hand, I will stay</p>

(music traditional; lyrics by Rodney Bennet)</p>

<p>Away in the ash grove, a lone bird is singing<br>
The wind whispers low in a sighing refrain<br>
Their music makes memories, voices go ringing<br>
The ash grove in beauty I see once again<br>
In still spite of sorrow, whene'er I remember<br>
My heart will return like a bird to the nest<br>
No matter how summer may fade to December<br>
There, in the ash grove, my heart be at rest</p>

<p>Away in the ash grove, a lone bird is singing<br>
The wind whispers low in a sighing refrain<br>
Their music makes memories, voices go ringing<br>
The ash grove in beauty I see once again<br>
The voices of friends that the long years have taken<br>
Oh faintly I hear them, the song and the word,<br>
How much in the heart can so little awaken:<br>
The wind in the leaves and the song of a bird</p>

(Words by Wendy Murphy, music by Brad Banyan)</p>

<p>   Dm                          B              C<br>
An April witch came to Yew ten years ago this Beltane eve.<br>
            Dm                                          B           C<br>
Spake she, "Your township's dearest prize will be mine own before I leave."<br>
    Dm                                     B
The Merchants went to hide their gold, the jewelers locked their gems away;<br>
    C                  Dm                    B             C
but she sought out our town's best bard, and in her golden voice did say,<br>
      Dm                                     B<br>
"Come dance with me the rites of spring! The grey is slipping from the skies.<br>
   C                  Dm               B        C              Dm<br>
To bring the bursting buds to bloom, I need the fire from your eyes."</p>

<p>His blue eyes danced as he played a run upon the lute he loved so well;<br>
"And what is it that you will give me in return, I pray thee tell?"<br>
"I give to thee twelve precious stones, the finest diamonds earth e're made,<br>
"A mantle of the finest silk I may now offer you in trade,<br>
"A castle made of ivory, to keep you safe from stormy skies;<br>
"For I must wake the Spring, and so I need the fire from your eyes."</p>

<p>"I thank you, no. The evening sky is filled with gems enough for me.<br>
"I love a storm, and so would find no peace in halls of ivory.<br>
"In midnight's mystic mantle I do feel myself most finely dressed.<br>
"So, Lady, I must ask you now if you have offered up your best;<br>
"For night draws nigh, 'tis time to sing, and we must say our fond good-byes<br>
"If you've no better offering to tempt the fire from my eyes."</p>

<p>She stood in somber thought, a perfect maid of rare immortal light.<br>
"I'll grant you your soul's secret wish to know true love for a single night.<br>
"I know the secret longings hidden deep within the songs you sing,<br>
"And though I've never loved I must now for the sake of the rising Spring.<br>
"I will fulfill your secret dream from now until the next sunrise<br>
"If you'll consent to let me have the fire from your eyes."</p>

<p>The midnight air was so alive, the stars so clear and bright<br>
That not a soul in all that town could sleep a wink that night.<br>
Wild music danced upon the breeze, but was too quickly gone.<br>
With her first tears the April Witch arose before the dawn;<br>
For a night or a season does what it must, it lives it's span and then it dies.<br>
She stole away from her sleeping love, taking the fire from his eyes.</p>

<p>Now, there's a festival in our fair town this Beltane eve.<br>
And the Bard is singing songs that only some of us believe,<br>
Of how on this day, for nine years upon one barren bush there grows<br>
Our single perfect heralding of spring -- a bright blue rose.<br>
He says it's where the witch's tears fell on that distant dawn;<br>
Her remembering of a love that lived for one night, and then was gone.<br>
And the strangers wonder why, when the Bard sings this song he cries,<br>
And the tears flow down his pallid cheeks from gray and empty eyes.</p>

<div><p><a id="The-Ball-of-Kerrimuir"><h2 class="song">The Ball of Kerrimuir</h2></a></p>

<p>There were four and twenty virgins<br>
Who came down from Inverness<br>
And when the ball was over<br>
There were four and twenty less</p>

<p><em>Singing balls to your partner,<br>
Your arse against the wall<br>
If you cannot get laid at Kerrymuir<br>
You'll never get laid at all.</em></p>

<p>They were doing it on the porches<br>
And doing it on the stones.<br>
You couldn't hear the music<br>
For the loud and joyful moans!</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>They were doing it in the parlor<br>
They were doing it on the stairs<br>
You couldn't see the ballroom floor<br>
For all the curly hairs.</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>They were doing it it the doorway<br>
They were doing it on the chair<br>
And when they found the trampoline<br>
They were doing it in the air</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>They were doing it on garden path<br>
They were doing it in the park,<br>
And when the candles had all gone out<br>
They were doing it in the dark</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>The Queen was in the parlour<br>
Eating bread and honey.<br>
The King was in the chambermaid<br>
And she was in the money</p>

<p>The King was in the counting house<br>
Counting out his wealth<br>
The Queen was in the parlor<br>
Playing with herself</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>The master of the orchestra,<br>
He went and lost his stick<br>
But he rose to the occasion<br>
And conducted with his prick</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>The village leper he was there<br>
But he didn't complain too much<br>
Since his cock had fallen off<br>
He did 'em with his crutch</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>The village baker he was there<br>
And he let out a scream<br>
Shouting that the girls were tarts<br>
As he filled them up with cream</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>The village piper, he was there<br>
Performed a mighty trick<br>
Pulled his foreskin over his head<br>
And piped upon his prick</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>A politician he was there<br>
Just sitting on his tush<br>
He never made it to the point<br>
Just beat about the bush</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>A diplomat was also there<br>
His country's flag unfurled<br>
He poked a hole into the ground<br>
And diddled the whole world</p>

(by Thomas Bordeaux)</p>

<p>Here in the kingdom of the West<br>
We're inclusive as can be<br>
We'd never rain on your parade<br>
Just 'cause we don't agree<br>
There's lots of ways to play this game<br>
We want you to have fun<br>
We'd never tell you what to do<br>
Or what should not be done</p>

<p>If you are of the Nipponese<br>
Well, that's all right with us<br>
We'll let you be a Samurai<br>
And we'll not make a fuss<br>
Sure, Western Europe's more our style<br>
But you're free to play your game<br>
We'd never want to hem you in<br>
'Cause it's really all the same</p>

<p>But ban the fencers<br>
They're all hopeless thugs and thieves<br>
They're dangerous, too brightly dressed<br>
And recreating sleaze<br>
Let's ban the fencers<br>
'Cause with us they don't belong<br>
And if you should see to disagree<br>
Then you'd best move along</p>

<p>And if you don't like costumes<br>
And sewing is a bore<br>
Just come to court in worn-out jeans<br>
We'd never ask for more<br>
It's more important what's inside<br>
Than what you won't put on<br>
We'd never tell you differently<br>
For that would just be wrong</p>

<p>And if you are of the Mongol Horde<br>
Well, you need not come to court<br>
What does that matter, anyhow?<br>
With you we'll still consort<br>
And you can call us "chugwa"<br>
Well, that just means "not tribe"<br>
We're mindful of your hopes and dreams<br>
Which we would not deride</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p><br>
And when it comes to music<br>
Just play what e'er you will<br>
Beatles filks are quite alright<br>
We never get our fill<br>
Don't worry 'bout those "period" songs<br>
Or about the way they're made<br>
We'd rather hear the raunchy ones<br>
About the girls you've laid</p>

<p>So if you ever come out to the West<br>
You know we'll treat you right<br>
We'll party 'til the cows come home and<br>
Howl at the moon all night<br>
We'll tell you, "Welcome to West<br>
Now please put on your clothes!"<br>
But please leave your rapiers behind<br>
We won't put up with those!</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>Yeah, ban the fencers<br>
Who are they to act like knights?<br>
And that white scarf just makes me barf<br>
We'll soon set things to right<br>
We're gonna ban the fencers<br>
'Cause they don't know right from wrong<br>
And if you should see to disagree<br>
Then you'd best move along!</p>

<div><p><a id="Black-Velvet-Band"><h2 class="song">Black Velvet Band</h2></a></p>

<p>To go in a smack down to Barking, where as a boy I apprentice was bound,<br>
Where I spent many hours in comfort and pleasure in that little town<br>
At length future prospects were blighted, as soon you may all understand,<br>
So by my downfall take a warning - beware of a black velvet band.</p>

<p>One day, being out on a ramble, alone by myself I did stray,<br>
I met with a young gay deceiver, while cruising on Ratcliffe Highway,<br>
Here eyes they were as a raven's, I thought her the pride of the land,<br>
Her hair hanging down on her shoulders was tied with a black velvet band.</p>

<p>She towed me in port and we anchored, from virtue she did me decoy,<br>
When it was proposed and agreed to that I should become a flash boy,<br>
And, drinking and gaming, to plunder to keep up the game soon was planned,<br>
But since, I had cause to remember the girl with the black velvet band.</p>

<p>Flash girl, if you wish to turn modest and strive a connection to gain,<br>
Do not wear a band over the forehead as if to toe in your brain;<br>
Some fret for Victoria's fashion, and some have their hair braided so grand,<br>
Myself I do think it much better than a girl with a black velvet band.</p>

<p>Young men, by my fate take a warning, from all those gay ladies refrain,<br>
And seek for a neat little woman that wears her hair parted and plain;<br>
The subject that now I do mention the innocent me soon trepanned,<br>
In sorrow my days will be ended, far from the black velvet band.</p>

<p>For she towed in a bold man-o'-war's man, her ogle she winked on the sly,<br>
But little did I know her meaning when I twigged her taking his cly,<br>
He said, 'I'm bound for the ocean, and shortly the ship will be manned,<br>
But still, I've a strong inclination for the girl with a black velvet band.</p>

<p>A snare was invented to slight and banish me out of her sight,<br>
A fogle she brought of no value, saying - 'More I will bring this night.'<br>
She slipped it sly into my pocket, false girl! and took me by the hand,<br>
They gave me in charge of the sneezer - bad luck to the black velvet band.</p>

<p>I quickly was nailed and committed, and cast in the jug for a lag,<br>
For a wipe that she pinched and bunged to me and valued no more than a flag,<br>
The judge said to me - 'You are sentenced to a free passage to Van Diemen's Land.'<br>
And far, far away from relations to abhor the black velvet band.</p>

<p>My lord, I write this note to you to tell you of my plight<br>
For at the time of writing I am not a pretty sight<br>
My body is all black and blue, my face a deathly grey<br>
And I write this note to tell you why I'm not at work today</p>

<p>Whilst working on the fourteenth floor, some bricks I had to clear<br>
But tossing them down from such a height was not a good idea<br>
The foreman wasn't very pleased; he is an awkward sod<br>
And he said I had to cart them down the ladders in my hod</p>

<p>Now carting all these bricks by hand, it was so very slow<br>
So I hoisted up a barrel and secured a rope below<br>
But in my haste to do the job, I was too blind to see<br>
That a barrel full of building bricks is heavier than me</p>

<p>And so when I untied the rope, the barrel fell like lead<br>
And clinging tightly to the rope I started up instead<br>
I shot up like a rocket and to my dismay I found<br>
That half way up I met the bloody barrel coming down</p>

<p>Well the barrel broke my shoulder, as to the ground it sped<br>
And when I reached the top I banged the pulley with my head<br>
I clung on tightly, numb with shock from this almighty blow<br>
As the barrel spilled out half its bricks some fourteen floors below</p>

<p>Now when these bricks had fallen from the barrel to the floor<br>
I then outweighed the barrel and so started down once more<br>
But I clung on tightly to the rope, my body racked with pain,<br>
And half way down, I met the bloody barrel once again</p>

<p>The force of this collision half way up the castle block<br>
Caused multiple abrasions and a nasty case of shock<br>
Still clinging tightly to the rope I fell towards the ground<br>
And I landed on the broken bricks the barrel scattered round.</p>

<p>I lay there groaning on the floor I thought I'd passed the worst<br>
But the barrel hit the pulley wheel, and then the bottom burst<br>
A shower of bricks rained down on me, I hadn't got a hope<br>
As I lay there bleeding on the ground, I let go the bloody rope.</p>

<p>The barrel then being heavier, it started down once more<br>
And landed right across me as I lay upon the floor<br>
It broke three ribs, and my left arm, and I can only say<br>
That I hope you'll understand why I am not at work today.</p>

<p>A man there lived in the north country<br>
<em>Hey ee ho and my bonny go</em><br>
And he had daughters one, two, three<br>
<em>The swans swim so bonny-o</em></p>

<p>These daughters they walked by the river's brim<br>
The eldest pushed the youngest in</p>

<p>Oh sister, oh sister, pray lend me your hand<br>
And I will give you house and land</p>

<p>I'll give you neither hand nor glove<br>
Unless you give me your own true love</p>

<p>Sometimes she sank, sometimes she swam<br>
Until she came to a miller's dam</p>

<p>The miller's daughter, dressed in red<br>
She went for some water to make some bread</p>

<p>Oh father, oh daddy, here swims a swan<br>
It's very like a gentlewoman</p>

<p>They placed her on the bank to dry<br>
There came a harper passing by</p>

<p>He made harp pins of her fingers fair<br>
He made harp strings of her golden hair</p>

<p>He made a harp of her breast bone<br>
And straight it began to play alone</p>

<p>He brought it to her father's hall<br>
And there was the court, assembled all</p>

<p>He laid the harp upon a stone<br>
And straight it began to play alone</p>

<p>And there does sit my father the King<br>
And yonder sits my mother the Queen</p>

<p>And there does sit my brother Hugh<br>
And by him William, sweet and true</p>

<p>And there does sit my false sister, Anne<br>
Who drowned me for the sake of a man</p>

<p>My mistress is a tinder box<br>
Would I had such a one<br>
Her steel endureth many a knock<br>
Both by the flint and stone<br>
And if you stir the tinder much<br>
The match will fire at the touch<br>
<em>Fa la la la la la-la-la
Fa la la la la la la</em></p>

<p>My mistress is a shuttlecock<br>
Composed of cork and feather<br>
Each battledore sits on her deck<br>
And bumps her on the leather<br>
But cast her off which way you will<br>
She recoils to another still<br>
<em>Fa la la la la la-la-la<br>
Fa la la la la la la</em></p>

<p>My mistress is a tennis ball<br>
Composed of cotton fine<br>
She's often struck against the wall<br>
And banded underline<br>
But if you would her wish fulfil<br>
You'd pop her in the hazard still<br>
<em>Fa la la la la la-la-la<br>
Fa la la la la la la</em></p>

<p>My mistress is a virginal<br>
And little cost will string her<br>
She's often reared against the wall<br>
For everyone to finger<br>
But if you would my mistress please<br>
You'd run division on her keys<br>
<em>Fa la la la la la-la-la<br>
Fa la la la la la la</em></p>

<p>My mistress is a cunny fine<br>
And of the finest skin<br>
And if you'd care to open her<br>
The best part lies within<br>
Yet in her cunny burrow may<br>
Two tumblers and a ferret play<br>
<em>Fa la la la la la-la-la<br>
Fa la la la la la la</em></p>

<p>But why should I my mistress call<br>
A shuttlecock or bauble<br>
A virginal, or tennis ball<br>
Which things are variable<br>
But to commend I'll say no more:<br>
my mistress is an arrant whore<br>
<em>Fa la la la la la-la-la<br>
Fa la la la la la la</em></p>

<p>There was a young sailor who looked through the glass,<br>
And spied a fair mermaid with scales on her island<br>
Where seagulls fly over their nests<br>
She combed the long hair that hung over her shoulders<br>
And caused her to tickle and itch.<br>
The sailor cried out "There's a beautiful mermaid,<br>
A-sitting out there on the rocks,”<br>
The crew came around a-grabbing their glasses<br>
And crowded four deep to the rail,<br>
All eager to share in this fine piece of news.<br>
Which the captain soon heard from the watch.<br>
He tied down the wheel and he reached for his crackers<br>
And cheese which he kept near the door.<br>
In case he might someday encounter a mermaid.<br>
He knew he must use all his wits<br>
Crying “Throw out a line, we'll lasso her flippers.”<br>
And then we will certainly find<br>
If mermaids are better before or be brave<br>
“My good fellows,” The captain then said.<br>
"With fortune we'll break through her mermaiden head<br>
-Ing to starboard” They tacked with dispatch.<br>
And caught that fair mermaid just under her elbows<br>
And hustled her down below decks,<br>
And each took a turn at her feminine setting<br>
Her free at the end of the farce,<br>
She splashed in the waves, falling flat on her after<br>
A while one man noticed some scabs,<br>
Soon they broke out with the pox and the scratching<br>
With fury, cursing with spleen.<br>
This song may be dull, but it's certainly clean.</p>

<p>Twas a cold morn' in the Autumn<br>
When we went upon our way<br>
Took up arms, and kissed the ladies<br>
And their eyes begged us to stay<br>
But a land there is for winnin'<br>
And the Kingdom we defend<br>
So we pick up all our weapons<br>
In the cold October wind</p>

<p>Oh I am John the tailor<br>
Makin' clothing is my trade<br>
And I never fought with any<br>
And I never held a blade<br>
But the enemy is comin'<br>
And we'll meet them on the field<br>
And though courage, it may leave me<br>
I swear I'll never yield</p>

<p><em>And we'll march through the Autumn<br>
Though the winds may howl and roar<br>
And we'll fight to the last man<br>
‘Til we push them to the shore<br>
And our children they are cryin'<br>
But the Kingdom we defend<br>
So we pick up all our weapons<br>
In the cold October wind</em></p>

<p>Oh I am Sean MacKenzie<br>
I'm the smithy of this town<br>
And I just spent all my earnings<br>
On my lady's wedding gown<br>
But the enemy is marching<br>
We can see them 'cross the field<br>
So we'll meet them in the heather<br>
With a clash of sword and shield</p>

<p><em>And we'll march through the Autumn<br>
Though the winds may howl and roar<br>
And we'll fight to the last man<br>
‘Til we push them to the shore<br>
And our boys they are all frightened<br>
But the Kingdom we defend<br>
So we'll meet them, and we'll battle<br>
In the cold October wind</em></p>

<p>I'm Simon, I'm a minstrel<br>
And I'm good with word and song<br>
And I'll drink with any rover<br>
And I'll sing the whole night long<br>
But the enemy is chargin'<br>
And the time for song is past<br>
So I'll pray my lassie hears me<br>
As I sing my very last</p>

<p><em>And we'll march through the Autumn<br>
Though the winds may howl and roar<br>

But the Kingdom we defend<br>
'Til the last of us has fallen<br>
In the cold October wind</em></p>

<p>And our army lies in ruins<br>
But I cannot say who lost<br>
For we kept them from our homeland<br>
But dear God what the cost!<br>
But the enemy was marching<br>
And the Kingdom we defend<br>
So we gather up our dyin'<br>
In the cold October wind</p>

<p><em>And we'll march through the Autumn<br>

O, Don't you remember our days of courtin',<br>
When your head lay upon my breast?<br>
You could make me believe by the falling of your arm,<br>
That the sun rose in the west.<br>
If I had known before I courted,<br>
That love had been so hard to win;<br>
I'd have locked my heart In a box of golden,<br>
And fastened it up with a silver pin.<br>
I wish I were a little sparrow,<br>
And I had wings, and I could fly;<br>
I'd fly away to my false true lover,<br>
And when he'd speak I would deny.<br>

I was born on a Dublin street where the Royal drums do beat<br>
And the loving English feet they tramped all over us,<br>
And each and every night when me father'd come home tight<br>
He'd invite the neighbors outside with this chorus:<br>
Oh, come out you black and tans,<br>
Come out and fight me like a man<br>
Show your wives how you won medals down in Flanders<br>
Tell them how the IRA made you run like hell away,<br>
From the green and lovely lanes in Killashandra.<br>
Come let me hear you tell<br>
How you slammed the great Pernell,<br>
When you fought them well and truly persecuted,<br>
Where are the smears and jeers<br>
That you bravely let us hear<br>
When our heroes of sixteen were executed.</p>

<p>(by Rathflaed DuNoir)<br>
It was on the first of June in AS Twenty-Six,<br>
A fighting ship was launched on the seas.<br>
She was the fastest thing on water; the jewel of the fleet,<br>
And they christened her the Crescent of Caid.<br>
The Captain ran a tight ship, two hundred in command,<br>
And none could ever equal her for speed,<br>
So the king he put his queen aboard to carry her to safety,<br>
Aboard the Crescent of Caid.<br>
Now the Pirate Captain Balthazaar, he called his ships together,<br>
There's a feast ahead, come and let us feed!<br>
I hear the royal flower, the Kingdom's sweetest rose,<br>
Is aboard the Crescent of Caid.<br>
So Hoist up the rigging boys, prime up the gonnes,<br>
Draw your cutlass, feel the waves beneath your feet,<br>
Two hundred men aboard the ship; we'll take her and we'll sink her,<br>
We'll have the Crescent of Caid!<br>
 Captain, we have a sail on the horizon,<br>
 Pirates to the North and West and East!<br>
 Well, hoist up the main sail and one-eighty to the rudder,<br>
 They'll never catch the Crescent of Caid!<br>
 All hands to stations, take the ladies down belowdecks,<br>
 And five men below to guard the queen,<br>
 We've promised to our liege lord, the safety of this flower,<br>
 A promise from the Crescent of Caid.<br>
Right boys, she's seen us; hard starboard to the rudder,<br>
Bring the ships full to ramming speed,<br>
Ready all grapples, Prepare the boarding party,<br>
We're taking down the Crescent of Caid!<br>
 Sir, we can't outrun them, we've got too much ballast,<br>
 Quickly sir, she's closing on our lead.<br>
 Then head her for the rocks me boys, in the Straits of Calafia,<br>
 They'll never catch the Crescent of Caid!<br>
They're turning to the rocks! The bastards think they'll lose us!<br>
When we catch them, I'll make that Morgan bleed!<br>
As sure as daylight breaks, and Polaris seeks to guide us,<br>
We'll soon have the Crescent of Caid!<br>
Within the deadly reefs the ships rolled almost over,<br>
As they sailed out, the tide it did recede,<br>
And left five pirate ships agrounded on the coral,<br>
And one still faced the Crescent of Caid.<br>
 The Pirate Captain's ship, she grappled with the Crescent,<br>
 The swords were flashing bright with desperate need.<br>
 The queen she drew a sword and gathered with her maidens,<br>
 And swore they'd never take the Crescent of Caid.<br>
 The battle swirled around and the pirates started dying,<br>
 Balthazaar, he called a swift retreat,<br>
 The pirate ship broke free and fled into the high seas,<br>
 Victorious was the Crescent of Caid!<br>
So learn this lesson well, all you pirates of the high seas,<br>
Don't try to take the treasures of Caid,<br>
For you will face Morgan and the Royal Caidian Navy,<br>
And her flagship the Crescent of Caid!<br>
Yes her flagship the Crescent of Caid!</p>

How I long to be with him from morning 'till night.<br>

Your captain will call you. It grieves my heart so!<br>

I'll pass as your comrade as we march along.<br>
I'll pass as your comrade. No one will ever know!<br>
Won't you let me go with you?<br>

<p> (traditional)<br>
Trees they grow high, and leaves they do grow green<br>
Many's the time that my true love I've seen<br>
For many an hour, I've watched him all alone<br>
He's young but he's daily growin'<br>
Father, dear father, you've done me great wrong<br>
You've married me to a boy who is too young<br>
For I am twice twelve and he is but fourteen<br>
He's young but he's daily growin'<br>
Daughter, dear daughter, I've done you no wrong<br>
I've married you to a great lord's son<br>
And he'll be a man for you when I'm dead and gone<br>
He's young but he's daily growin'<br>
Father, dear father, if you see fit<br>
We'll send him to college for another year yet<br>
I'll tie a blue ribbon all around his head<br>
To let the ladies know that he's married.<br>
As I was looking over my young love's college wall<br>
I saw all the boys there a-playing at the ball<br>
And my own true love he was the flower of them all<br>
He's young but he's daily growin'<br>
And so early in the morning, at the dawning of the day<br>
They went into the hayfield for to have some sport and play<br>
And what they did there, well, she never would declare<br>
But she never more complained of his growin'<br>
At the age of fourteen, he was a married man<br>
At the age of fifteen, the father of a son<br>
At the age of sixteen, his grave, it was green<br>
And death had put an end to his growin'<br>
And now my love is dead and in his grave is lain.<br>
The grass it grows o'er him so very, very green.<br>
I'll sit and I will mourn his fate until the day I die,<br>
And I'll watch o'er his child, while he's growin'<br>
I'll buy my love some flannel and I make my love a shroud<br>
With every stitch I put in it, the tears they will pour down<br>
With every stitch I put in it, how the tears they will flow<br>
Cruel fate has put an end to his growing.<br>
The trees they grow high and the leaves they do grow green<br>
But the time is gone and past, my love, that you and I have seen<br>
It's a cold winter's night, my love, and I must abide alone<br>
So fare you well my true love, for ever</p>

<p>(by Danny Carnahan)<br>
Welcome in my thirsty fellows<br>
Hang your hats inside the door<br>
If we're only packed to bursting<br>
Then there's surely room for more<br>
We'll deny the cold of winter<br>
We'll have only song and cheer<br>
As we gather here together<br>
In the threshold of the year<br>
And here's a dram to warm the piper<br>
Here's a dram to warm the hall<br>
Here's a dram to raise the rafters<br>
And here's long life to you all<br>
Here we tied the knot as lovers<br>
Here we raised the toast as friends<br>
Here we pass along from hand to hand<br>
In a dance that never ends<br>
We'll forget about tomorrow<br>
We're protected from it here<br>
As we all sink back together<br>
In the cradle of the year</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>Crack the seal off of the bottle<br>
Light the fire beneath the still<br>
Let it soak us to the elbows<br>
As we medicate our ills<br>
Sure the whisky is forgiving<br>
It will wash our conscience clear<br>
As we drink our fill together<br>
From the tankard of the year</p>

To the old chrome cassette of my mother's voice<br>
I still cry when I hear her sing<br>
The clock struck twelve; the voice I love so well<br>
Was eaten up by the machine<br>
It was eaten up by the machine<br>
When the glass is full, drink up, drink up<br>
This may be the last time we see this cup<br>
If God wanted us sober, he'd knock the glass over<br>
So while it is full we drink up</p>

<p>A toast to Mary, a girl I once loved<br>
Oh Lord, why do things have to die?<br>
If drinking beer could bring her back here<br>
I'd drink the damn place dry<br>
Yes, I'd drink the damn place dry</p>

<p>Here's to the old house on Lily Pond Lane<br>

Or leave a kiss within the cup<br>
And I'll not ask for wine.<br>
The thirst that from the soul doth rise<br>
Doth ask a drink divine;<br>
But might I of Jove's nectar sip,<br>
I would not change for thine.<br>
I sent thee late a rosy wreath,<br>
Not so much hon'ring thee<br>
As giving it a hope that there<br>
It could not withered be;<br>
But thou thereon did'st only breathe,<br>
And sent'st it back to me,<br>
Since when it grows and smells, I swear<br>
Not of itself, but thee.</p>

<p>(by Betsy Tinney)<br>
The ghost of a dryad haunts an old wooden schooner<br>
She clings to the mainmast like mist in the trees<br>
Mourning his death after so many years<br>
She weaves her grief into the breeze<br>
Singing<br>
Blow, you ocean wind, blow<br>
Blow this ship back to the forested shore<br>
For these foamy green hills are but saltwater desert<br>
And I yearn to see woodland once more<br>
And sometimes at full moon, the sailors can see her<br>
Her misty grey figure glides silently past<br>
But when the storms howl, you can hear her heart weeping<br>
And see her blue glow round the mast<br>
Crying<br>
Blow, you ocean storm, blow<br>
Blow this ship back to the forested shore<br>
For your wet whipping winds bring no life to my lost love<br>
And I yearn to see woodland once more<br>
Warm summer breezes remind Pity's daughter<br>
Of seasons and centuries spent merged with her pine<br>
When sap of his heartwood ran warm with her laughter<br>
Her voice in his branches entwined<br>
Whispering<br>
Grow, sweet conifer, grow<br>
Reach for the sun, leave the green earth behind<br>
For whatever happens, my tallest of princes<br>
I never shall leave my white pine.<br>
On the deck of the schooner, surrounded by ocean<br>
The towering mast stands, so lifeless yet strong<br>
And the ghost of the dryad, cool shade in his shadow<br>
Renews her promise alone<br>
Singing<br>
Blow, you summer breeze, blow<br>
You help me remember why I stay behind<br>
Though alone and adrift on this great leafless ocean<br>
I still cannot leave my white pine --<br>
No, I never will leave my white pine.</p>

In days of old in a kingdom bold, there lived a fearsome dragon;<br>
And the King he was in great distress and the country's spirits flaggin'.<br>
Until one day there came a knight, he was handsome, bold, and charming,<br>
And he slew the dragon with his sword with a smile that was so disarming.<br>
With a hey and a ho and a hey nonny no, a smile that was so disarming.<br>
Said the King I wish to know your name, but the knight said do not bother.<br>
For the name of a knight of the realm says he, is the same as any other.<br>
Said the King tonight in my daughter's bed you shall take your leisure<br>
And she'll reward you for your deed, with a night of exotic pleasure.<br>
With a hey and a ho and a hey nonny no, a night of exotic pleasure.<br>
One daughter she has raven hair, a maiden young and chaste,<br>
And she sleeps all night in the pale moonlight, naked to her waist.<br>
The other daughter she is fair, the fairest in the town,<br>
And she sleeps all night in the pale moonlight, naked from her small waist down.<br>
With a hey and a ho and a hey nonny no, naked from her small waist down.<br>
Well the knight he spent many an hour behind that castle wall,<br>
But the ending to my story dear isn't what it seems at all.<br>
For in neither bed of neither maid was he repaid for his glory;<br>
But he slept all night with the King instead for this is a fairy story.<br>
With a hey and a ho and a hey nonny no, for this is a Fairy Story.</p>

<p> (by Ken and Lisa Theriot)<br>
I'm never late for dining in the feast hall<br>
When dinner's called, I hasten to my seat<br>
It's not that I'm assuming<br>
That the meal will be a treat<br>
But the first things on the table<br>
May be all I have to eat</p>

<p>The bread and cheese are laid out on the table<br>
And butter, honeyed, mixed with herbs, or straight<br>
I'll tuck into them greedily<br>
And pile them on my plate<br>
For then there'll be no room<br>
And they'll believe me when I state...<br>
I'm sure the next remove's not on my diet<br>
I see that I cannot identify it<br>
[I'll pass on all the slimy stuff<br>
And anything with peas]<br>
Just give me bread and butter, and cheese.</p>

<p>There must have been a special on cilantro<br>
Or why else would it be in every dish?<br>
They've cooked enough for armies,<br>
You can take all that you wish<br>
But how much can you eat<br>
Of boiled snouts and pickled fish?</p>

<p>I never knew that you could do that with a turnip<br>
To eat it would be really such a crime<br>
There's something green that's floating<br>
In a milky pool of slime<br>
My lord, please pass the basket<br>
With the bread here one more time... </p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>[The rancid meat's more period,<br>
It helps keep down the fleas]</p>

<p>The cook went over budget on the peacock<br>
That's why we're getting gruel with every course<br>
They say the candied herring<br>
Soaked in mead's authentic Norse<br>
This roasted meat is not half bad,<br>
But where's the Prince's horse?</p>

<p>I don't know how they got that shade of purple<br>
I can't begin to guess what's in the pies<br>
The fish head stew's okay,<br>
But did they need to leave the eyes?<br>
And will our waivers cover us when everybody dies?</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>[Just take the sheep's head right back<br>
To the kitchen, will you please?]</p>

<p>The suckling pig is only raw in places<br>
I guess a bite of cabbage wouldn't hurt<br>
They say it's more nutritious<br>
If you don't wash off the dirt<br>
At least the last remove is safe—<br>
How can they wreck dessert?</p>

<p>There's something frittered (best not look too closely)<br>
And sugared eggplant jiggling in the heat<br>
The pie looks just like cherry,<br>
But it's really made with beet<br>
Just pass the honey butter<br>
And I'll have my something sweet!</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>[And if I ever win the Crown,<br>
We're going for Chinese!<br>
But 'til then just pass the butter,<br>
Let the Cook's Guild moan and mutter,<br>
And bring me bread and butter, and cheese!]</p>

"Michael, they are sending you away.<br>
For you stole Trevelyan's corn,<br>
So the young might see the morn,<br>
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay."<br>
Low lie the fields of Athenry<br>
Where once we watched the small free birds fly<br>
Oh, our love was on the wing<br>
We had dreams and songs to sing<br>
It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry.<br>
By a lonely prison wall<br>
I heard a young man calling<br>
"Nothing matters, Mary, when you're free<br>
Against the famine and the crown,<br>
I rebelled, they ran me down,<br>
Now you must raise our child with dignity."<br>
 Chorus</p>

<p>By a lonely harbour wall,<br>
She watched the last star falling<br>

It's so lonely ‘round the fields of Athenry.</p>

<p>'Twas down the glen one Easter morn<br>
To a city fair rode I.<br>
When armed lines of marching men<br>
In squadrons passed me by.<br>
No pipe did hum, no battle drum<br>
Did sound its loud tattoo<br>
But the Angelus bell o'er the Liffey's swell<br>
Rang out in the foggy dew.<br>
Right proudly high in Dublin town<br>
Hung they out the flag of war.<br>
'Twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky<br>
Than at Suvla or Sud el Bar.<br>
And from the plains of Royal Meath<br>
Strong men came a-hurrying through;<br>
While Brittania's huns with their long-range guns<br>
Sailed in through the foggy dew.<br>
'Twas Brittania bade our wild geese go<br>
That small nations might be free.<br>
Their lonely graves are by Suvla's waves<br>
On the fringe of the grey North Sea.<br>
Oh had they died by Pearse's side<br>
Or fought with Cathal Brugha<br>
Their graves we'd keep where the Fenians sleep<br>
'Neath the shroud of the foggy dew.<br>
But the bravest fell, and the requiem bell<br>
Rang mournfully and clear<br>
For those who died that Easter tide<br>
In the springing of the year<br>
And the world did gaze with deep amaze<br>
At those fearless men but few<br>
Who bore the fight that freedom's light<br>
Might shine through the foggy dew<br>
Back through the glen I rode again<br>
Though my heart with grief was sore<br>
For I parted then, with valiant men<br>
whom I never shall see more<br>
But to and fro in my dreams I go<br>
And I'll kneel and pray for you<br>
For slavery fled, O glorious dead,<br>
When you fell in the foggy dew</p>

Fra brooding o'er the old disgrace<br>
That black FitzWilliam stormed your place,<br>
Drove you to the Fern!<br>
Grey said victory was sure<br>
Soon the Firebrand he'd secure;<br>
Until he met at Glenmalure<br>
One Feagh MacHugh O'Byrne.<br>
Curse and swear Lord Kildare!<br>
Feagh will do what Feagh will dare<br>
Now FitzWilliam, have a care<br>
Fallen is your star, low<br>
Up with halberd, out with sword!<br>
On we'll go for by the Lord!<br>
Feagh MacHugh has given the word:<br>
Follow me up to Carlow!<br>
See the swords of Glen Imayle,<br>
Flashing o'er the English Pale<br>
See all the children of the Gael,<br>
Beneath O'Byrne's banners<br>
Rooster of the fighting stock,<br>
Would you let a Saxon cock<br>
Crow out upon an Irish rock,<br>
Fly up and teach him manners.</p>

<p>From Tassagart to Clonmore,<br>
There flows a stream of Saxon gore<br>
Och, great is Rory Oge O'More,<br>

White is sick and Lane is fled,<br>
Now for black FitzWilliam's head<br>
We'll send it over, dripping red,<br>
To Queen Liza and her ladies.</p>

<p> (by James Treebull the Stubborn (mka Jim Pipkin))<br>

Grim warriors appeared, decked in iron and gold,<br>
Their bright banners snapped in the breeze<br>
Harvest was over, the weather was cold<br>
Turning hot breath to cloud in the freeze.<br>
They moved over rivers, and meadows and fields<br>
The peasantry scattered before<br>
They gathered the wealth of the land on their shields<br>
And carried it off to the shore.<br>
"How can this happen, and where is our King?<br>
And where are the warriors we pay?"<br>
"Aye, the King may be King where he sits on his throne,<br>
But his throne is four days ride away!"<br>
Swift word was sent to the men of the woods<br>
There'll be no trade for Winter this year.<br>
No sacks of grain for the skin of the fox,<br>
No ale for the flesh of the deer.<br>
But deep in the woodlands of Wales grows a tree,<br>
And the name of that tree is the yew.<br>
And the fruit of the yew is a stout longbow stave<br>
Throwing straight clothyard shafts strong and true!<br>
They gathered in numbers from forest and fen<br>
Walking soft as the hunting-men do,<br>
And hung at their belts were the straight clothyard shafts<br>
In each hand was the fruit of the yew.<br>
And, slipping by night through the still-burning steads,<br>
They looked for the camp by the shore<br>
And each made a vow, as he passed by the dead,<br>
That the morning would even the score.<br>
Well, morning broke clear, and the raiders awoke,<br>
With a leisurely thought for the day<br>
Till one showed himself, and a soft bowstring spoke,<br>
From three hundred paces away!<br>
And as he fell dead, a loud, taunting voice spoke<br>
"It's a pleasure to pay you your due!"<br>
"You came seeking all of the fruits of our land,<br>
Have a taste of the fruit of the yew!"<br>
What use are shields that don't cover the legs?<br>
Or helms that don't cover the eyes?<br>
Or shirts of bright mail 'gainst the stout clothyard shaft<br>
That can pierce through a stag on the fly?<br>
The King arrived early, mud-spattered and tired,<br>
Just to look on a field of the dead.<br>
Cut down from the front as they stood in their line,<br>
Cut down from the rear as they fled!<br>
"And where are the men that have done me this deed?"<br>
Asked the King, from his horse ridden lame,<br>
"'Twas outlaws and brigands from back in the woods,<br>
They've since fled back whence they all came."<br>
"And would they take Pardon, and live in my Peace?"<br>
Asked the King of his Councilor true,<br>
Said the Councilor, "Nay, they're a quarrelsome lot;<br>
They'll not become lawful for you."<br>
Raiders, take heed to the gist of my tale<br>
(It may lengthen your lives, if you will!)<br>
When you go a-reavin' be sure of your mark!<br>
Take care that it matches your skill!<br>
For England pays silver, and Spain will give gold,<br>
And France will grant land, that is true,<br>
But seek not for wealth in the woodlands of Wales,<br>
For THEY pay in the fruit of the yew!</p>

Wassail, wassail all over the town,<br>
The bowl it is white and the ale it is brown;<br>
The bowl it is made of the good ashen tree<br>
With a wassail bowl I drink unto thee<br>
O maid, O maid, with your glove and your lace<br>
Pray open the door now and show your us face,<br>
Pray open the door and let us all in,<br>
For to fill our wassail bowls then leave you again<br>

Who came to the door and opened the lock<br>
Who came to the door and pulled back the pin<br>

Come butler, come bring us a bowl of the best<br>
And we pray that your soul in heaven may rest<br>

And here's to the ox and to his right horn<br>
May God send our master a good crop of corn<br>
As good crop of corn as e'r I did see<br>
With a wassail bowl I drink unto thee<br>

O master and mistress, if we've been too bold<br>
Pray close up the door and leave us to the cold<br>

<p> (by John Charles Holloway)</p>

<p>Once upon a time lived a fair princess,<br>
Most beautiful and charming;<br>
Her father, the king, was a wicked old thing<br>
With manners most alarming.<br>
And always on the front doorstep<br>
A most ferocious Dragon slept,<br>
Who made such a fearful shrieking noise,<br>
So all you little girls and boys<br>
 Beware! Take care! For the green-eyed dragon<br>
 With the thirteen tails will feed, with greed,<br>
 On little boys and puppy dogs and great fat snails<br>
 And off to his lair each child he'll drag<br>
 And each of his thirteen tails he'll wag,<br>
Beware! Take care! And creep upon tiptoe,<br>
 And hurry up the stairs, and say your prayers,<br>
 And tuck your head, your pretty curly head,<br>
 Beneath the clothes, the clothes, the clothes.</p>

<p>That dragon he lived for years and years<br>
And he never got much thinner.<br>
For lunch, he'd try some policeman pie<br>
Or roast M.P. for dinner;<br>
One brave man went 'round with an axe<br>
And tried to collect his income tax -<br>
The dragon he smiled with fiendish glee<br>
And sadly murmured 'R.I.P.'<br>
 Chorus</p>

<p>The dragon went down to the kitchen one day<br>
Where the fair princess was baking;<br>
He ate, by mistake, some rich plum cake<br>
which the fair princess was making.<br>
This scrumptious cake, he could not digest;<br>
So he moaned and he groaned, and at last went west -<br>
And now his ghost, with bloodshot eyes<br>
At midnight clanks his chains and cries:</p>

<p>Good sailors sing songs of lassies and bravery and fortune.<br>
How the sea fills their hearts with the courage to do mighty deeds.<br>

Who tested the bravest of brave in all seven seas. It were...<br>

One mighty sup puts the wind in your sail<br>
It's Happy Jack's undrinkable ale<br>
Our captain once tried a tankard of Jack's mighty potion.<br>

<p>An Ulsterman I am proud to be<br>
From Antrim Town I come.<br>
All my life I have laboured by the sea<br>
‘Til I followed fife and drum.<br>
I have heard the martial tramp of men<br>
I've watched them fight and die.<br>
And I always will remember when<br>
I followed Henry Joy.</p>

<p>I pulled my boat from out the sea<br>
And I hid my sails away,<br>
I cast my net into tree<br>
And I scanned the moonlit bay.<br>
The boys were out, and the Redcoats too,<br>
I kissed my wife goodbye;<br>
And there in the shade of a greenwood glade<br>
I followed Henry Joy.</p>

<p>In Antrim town the tyrant stood,<br>
He tore our ranks with ball,<br>
But with a cheer and a pike to clear<br>
We swept them o'er the wall.<br>
Our pikes and sabres flushed that day,<br>
We won, but lost, ah, why?<br>
No matter lads, I fought beside<br>
And shielded Henry Joy.</p>

<p>Ah, lads, for Ireland's cause we fought;<br>
For her and home we bled,<br>
Though our numbers were few, our hearts beat true,<br>
And five to one lay dead,<br>
There was many a lassie lost her lad,<br>
A mother lost her boy;<br>
For youth was strong in that dashing throng<br>
That followed Henry Joy.</p>

<p>In Belfast town they built the tree,<br>
And the redcoats mustered there.<br>
I watched them come as the beat of a drum,<br>
Sounded out in the barracks' square.<br>
He kissed his sister and climbed aloft,<br>
He bid us all good-bye.<br>
By God, when he died, I turned and I cried,<br>
"They've murdered Henry Joy!”</p>

The circle of the world shines bright and holy<br>
The seasons tread their spiral path with grace<br>
It is not the world's designer but the world itself we honor<br>
And the stars shine out across our Lady's face<br>
But the world might end -- and the stars might fall<br>
Yet Her light will be laughing at the heart of it all<br>
She is in each force with strangeness and charm<br>
And the holographic universe is enfolded in Her arms<br>
Our Lady is non-local; sing we Her praise<br>
She is the hidden variable that lights our days<br>
With book and with candle<br>
With Gödel and Bell<br>
With wave and with particle we worship Her well</p>

<p>Our Lady is uncertain; sing we in prayer<br>
We don't know how fast She may be moving or where<br>
With koan and theorem<br>
With Pauli and Bohr<br>
We open Her mysteries and inside we find more</p>

<p>Our Lady is acausal; work we Her math<br>
Her field equations are a bitch and a half<br>
With implicate order<br>

<p>(music by Phil Ochs, lyrics by Alfred Noyes)<br>
The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees,<br>
The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,<br>
The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,<br>
And the highwayman came riding—<br>
Riding—riding—<br>
The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door.<br>
He'd a French cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,<br>
A coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin<br>
They fitted with never a wrinkle: his boots were up to the thigh!<br>
And he rode with a jewelled twinkle,<br>
His pistol butts a-twinkle,<br>
His rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky.<br>
Over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard,<br>
And he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred;<br>
He whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there<br>
But the landlord's black-eyed daughter,<br>
Bess, the landlord's daughter,<br>
Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.<br>
"One kiss, my bonny sweetheart, I'm after a prize to-night,<br>
But I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light;<br>
Yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day,<br>
Then look for me by moonlight,<br>
Watch for me by moonlight,<br>
I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way."<br>
He rose upright in the stirrups; he scarce could reach her hand,<br>
But she loosened her hair i' the casement! His face burnt like a brand<br>
As the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast;<br>
And he kissed its waves in the moonlight,<br>
(Oh, sweet, black waves in the moonlight!)<br>
Then he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the West.<br>
He did not come in the dawning; he did not come at noon;<br>
And out o' the tawny sunset, before the rise o' the moon,<br>
When the road was a gypsy's ribbon, looping the purple moor,<br>
A red-coat troop came marching—<br>
Marching— marching—<br>
King George's men came matching, up to the old inn-door.<br>
They said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead,<br>
But they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow bed;<br>
Two of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side!<br>
There was death at every window;<br>
And hell at one dark window;<br>
For Bess could see, through her casement, the road that he would ride.<br>
They had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest;<br>
They had bound a musket beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast!<br>
"Now, keep good watch!" and they kissed her. She heard the dead man say—<br>
Look for me by moonlight;<br>
Watch for me by moonlight;<br>
I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way!<br>
She twisted her hands behind her; but all the knots held good!<br>
She writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat and blood!<br>
They stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like years,<br>
Till, now, on the stroke of midnight,<br>
Cold, on the stroke of midnight,<br>
The tip of one finger touched it! The trigger at least was hers!<br>
The tip of one finger touched it; she strove no more for the rest!<br>
Up, she stood up to attention, with the barrel beneath her breast,<br>
She would not risk their hearing; she would not strive again;<br>
For the road lay bare in the moonlight;<br>
Blank and bare in the moonlight;<br>
And the blood of her veins in the moonlight throbbed to her love's refrain .<br>
Tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse-hoofs ringing clear;<br>
Tlot-tlot, tlot-tlot, in the distance? Were they deaf that they did not hear?<br>
Down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill,<br>
The highwayman came riding,<br>
Riding, riding!<br>
The red-coats looked to their priming! She stood up, straight and still!</p>

<p>Tlot-tlot, in the frosty silence! Tlot-tlot, in the echoing night!<br>
Nearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light!<br>
Her eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath,<br>
Then her finger moved in the moonlight,<br>
Her musket shattered the moonlight,<br>
Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him—with her death.</p>

<p>He turned; he spurred to the West; he did not know who stood<br>
Bowed, with her head o'er the musket, drenched with her own red blood!<br>
Not till the dawn he heard it, his face grew grey to hear<br>
How Bess, the landlord's daughter<br>
The landlord's black-eyed daughter,<br>
Had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there<br>
Back, he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky,<br>
With the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high!<br>
Blood-red were his spurs i' the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet coat,<br>
When they shot him down on the highway,<br>
Down like a dog on the highway,<br>
And he lay in his blood on the highway, with the bunch of lace at his throat.<br>
And still of a winter's night, they say, when the wind is in the trees,<br>
When the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,<br>
When the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,<br>
A highwayman comes riding—<br>
Riding—riding—<br>
A highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door.<br>
Over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard;<br>
He taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred;<br>
He whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there<br>
But the landlord's black-eyed daughter,<br>
Bess, the landlord's daughter,<br>
Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.</p>

The careful text-books measure<br>
(Let all who build beware!)<br>
The load, the shock, the pressure<br>
Material can bear.<br>
So, when the buckled girder<br>
Lets down the grinding span,<br>
'The blame of loss, or murder,<br>
Is laid upon the man.<br>
Not on the Stuff - the Man!<br>
But in our daily dealing<br>
With stone and steel, we find<br>
The Gods have no such feeling<br>
Of justice toward mankind.<br>
To no set gauge they make us-<br>
For no laid course prepare-<br>
And presently o'ertake us<br>
With loads we cannot bear:<br>
Too merciless to bear. <br>
The prudent text-books give it<br>
In tables at the end<br>
'The stress that shears a rivet<br>
Or makes a tie-bar bend-<br>
'What traffic wrecks macadam-<br>
What concrete should endure-<br>
but we, poor Sons of Adam<br>
Have no such literature,<br>
To warn us or make sure!<br>
We hold all Earth to plunder -<br>
All Time and Space as well-<br>
Too wonder-stale to wonder<br>
At each new miracle;<br>
Till, in the mid-illusion<br>
Of Godhead 'neath our hand,<br>
Falls multiple confusion<br>
On all we did or planned-<br>
 The mighty works we planned. <br>
We only of Creation<br>
(Oh, luckier bridge and rail!)<br>
Abide the twin damnation- <br>
To fail and know we fail.<br>
Yet we - by which sole token<br>
We know we once were Gods-<br>
Take shame in being broken<br>
However great the odds-<br>
The burden of the Odds.<br>
Oh, veiled and secret Power<br>
Whose paths we seek in vain,<br>
Be with us in our hour<br>
Of overthrow and pain;<br>
That we - by which sure token<br>
We know Thy ways are true -<br>
In spite of being broken,<br>
Because of being broken<br>
May rise and build anew<br>
Stand up and build anew!</p>

Liten Karin hon frågar sin svärmoder så<br>
Hur länge plägar kvinnan med barnet gå</p>

<p>I fyrtio veckor allt medan sju år<br>
Så länge plägar kvinnan med barnet gå<br>
Å Silibrand körde uppå höga loftessvala<br>
Där fick han se sin dotter i lunden fara<br>

Jag ser min dotter hon kommer til mej<br>
Härifrån for jag då jag var mö<br>
Nu kommer jag igen nu skall jag ock dö<br>
Å Silibrand fämnar ut kappan så blå<br>
Där föder hon två karska svenbarnen på<br>
Min svärmor skall jag giva min silvskodda kniv<br>
Hon har nu förått mitt unga liv<br>
Min fader skall jag giva min gångare grå<br>
Som han skall rida till kyrkan uppå<br>
Min syster skall jag giva mina guldringar sju<br>
Som jag ej haft sen jag stod brud<br>
Min broder skall jag giva mina handskar små<br>
Som han skall ha lik vart han går<br>
Den ene så för dom till Frejas dop<br>
Den andre så för dom till Vallhalla sal</p>

<p>(by J.M. Crofts)<br>
In the year of our Lord sixteen hundred and six<br>
We set sail from the sweet cove of Cork<br>
We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks<br>
For the fine city hall in New York<br>
'Twas a elegant craft, she was rigged fore-and-aft<br>
And oh, how the wild winds drove her.<br>
She had twenty-three masts and withstood several blasts<br>
And we called her the Irish Rover.<br>
There was Barney McGee from the banks of the Lee,<br>
There was Hogan from County Tyrone<br>
There was William McGurk who was scared stiff of work<br>
And a man from Westmeath called Malone<br>
There was Slugger O'Toole who was drunk as a rule<br>
And fighting Bill Casey from Dover<br>
And yer man Mick McCann from the banks of the Bann<br>
Was the skipper of the Irish Rover<br>
We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags<br>
We had two million barrels of bones<br>
We had three million sides of old blind horses hides,<br>
We had four million barrels of stones.<br>
We had five million hogs, six million dogs,<br>
Seven million barrels of porter.<br>
We had eight million bales of old nanny goats' tails,<br>
In the hold of the Irish Rover.<br>
We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out<br>
And the ship lost it's way in a fog.<br>
And the whole of the crew was reduced down to two,<br>
Just myself and the captain's old dog.<br>
When the ship struck a rock - Lord, what a shock<br>
And she nearly keeled right over<br>
She turned nine times around, and the poor old dog was drowned<br>
I'm the last of the Irish Rover</p>

<p>I am a young sailor, my story is sad<br>
For once I was carefree and a brave sailor lad<br>
I courted a lassie by night and by day<br>
Oh, but now she has left me and sailed far away<br>
Oh, if I was a blackbird, could whistle and sing<br>
I'd follow the vessel my true love sails in<br>
And in the top rigging I would there build my nest<br>
And I'd flutter my wings o'er her lily-white breast<br>
Or if I was a scholar and could handle a pen<br>
One secret love letter to my true love I'd send<br>
And I'd tell of my sorrow, my grief and my pain<br>
Since she's gone and left me in yon flowery glen<br>
Oh, if I was a blackbird, could whistle and sing<br>
I'd follow the vessel my true love sails in<br>
And in the top rigging I would there build my nest<br>
And I'd flutter my wings o'er her lily-white breast<br>
I sailed o'er the ocean my fortune to seek<br>
Though I missed her caress and her kiss on my cheek<br>
I returned and I told her my love was still warm<br>
But she turned away lightly and great was her scorn</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>I offered to take her to Donnybrook Fair<br>
And to buy her fine ribbons to tie up her hair<br>
I offered to marry and to stay by her side<br>
But she says in the morning she sails with the tide</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>My parents they chide me, oh, they will not agree<br>
Saying that me and my false love married should never be<br>
Ah, but let them deprive me, oh, let them do what they will<br>
While there's breath in my body she's the one that I love still</p>

<p> (by Lucien de Pontivy mka Myra Hope Eskridge)<br>
Indigo night shining<br>
Soft and low harp singing<br>
Under the leaves and the moonlight<br>
Strong and wide branches<br>
Reaching high, reaching in<br>
Weaving the wind and the starlight<br>
Clear and bright<br>
Shining through the night<br>
Harp singing<br>
Braided light finding the sun<br>
In Fading Light</p>

<p> (music by Lucien de Pontivy mka Myra Hope Eskridge, lyrics by Caera Aislingeach)<br>
I love to watch the world in fading light<br>
In peace that comes at closing of the day<br>
And moves on with the coming of the night<br>
Brown hair turns red and gold in slanted light<br>
The breeze draws scents of earth and leaves astray<br>
I love to watch the world in fading light<br>
Small, gray wings dance in ambivalent flight<br>
And owls and crickets now have much to say<br>
They sing to bring the coming of the night<br>
The sound of running water birngs delight<br>
The stream calls me to sit, quiet, and stay<br>
I love to watch the world in fading light<br>
Leaves rustle from somewhere nearby out of sight<br>
Could be birds of squirrels or maybe fey<br>
Dancing for the coming of the night<br>
A beech supports my back and all is right<br>
We softly hold the dark and cold at the bay<br>
I love to watch the world in fading light<br>
From here, before the coming of the night<br>
Isn't It Grand, Boys?</p>

<p>Look at the [D]coffin, with [G]silver handles.<br>
Isn't it [D]grand, boys, to be [E7]bloody well [A7]dead?<br>

<p>(by Alison Krauss)<br>
In the spring of 1856 with the snow still on the ground<br>
Two little boys were lost in the mountains above the town<br>
The father went out hunting, the boys had stayed behind<br>
While mother tended to her chores, they wandered from her side<br>
The two had gone to follow him and lost their way instead<br>
By dusk the boys had not been found and fear had turned to dread<br>
Two hundred men had gathered there to comb the mountain side<br>
The fires were built on the highest peak in hopes they'd see the light<br>
Ohh, mommy and daddy why can't you hear our cries?<br>
The day is almost over, soon it will be night<br>
We're so cold and hungry and our feet are tired and sore<br>
We promise not to stray again from our cabin door<br>
Now, Jacob Dibert woke one night from a strange and eerie dream<br>
He saw a path between two hills near a dark and swollen stream<br>
He told his wife he saw the boys huddled close beside a log<br>
For two more nights the dream returned, this vision sent from God<br>
Ohh, mommy and daddy why can't you hear our cries?<br>
The day is almost over, soon it will be night<br>
We're so cold and hungry and our feet are tired and sore<br>
We promise not to stray again from our cabin door<br>
A thousand men had searched in vain the west side of Pop's Creek<br>
But Jacob's wife knew of this place and said to travel east<br>
With a guide to take him there, Jacob came upon the scene<br>
And found the boys cold and still beneath the old birch tree<br>
Ohh, mommy and daddy, look past the tears you cry<br>
We're both up in heaven now, God is by our side<br>
As you lay us down to rest in the presence of the Lord<br>
Know that we will meet you here at Heaven's door<br>
Ohh, mommy and daddy, look past the tears you cry<br>
We're both up in heaven now, God is by our side<br>
And as you lay us down to rest in the presence of the Lord<br>
Know that we will meet you here at Heaven's door</p>

John Barleycorn to the sea has gone<br>
In a ship both stout and new,<br>
The thirst to slake of Captain Drake<br>
And all his loyal crew<br>
To venture brave o'er wind and wave,<br>
The Spanish for to halt,<br>
And though he'll die of Spanish grape<br>
He'll live as English malt.<br>
So we'll cut him down and we'll bind him round<br>
And we'll serve him worse than that,<br>
For we'll grind his bones between two stones<br>
And we'll bung him in a vat.<br>
Then we'll drink his health in nut-brown ale,<br>
And we'll drain our tankards dry,<br>
For before that he can live again<br>
John Barleycorn must die!<br>
John Barleycorn to the court has gone<br>
All dressed in rich array,<br>
In pewter clad from toe to head<br>
To win a lady gay.<br>
The poetry that he declaims<br>
Will stand him in good stead,<br>
For the ladies fair do all declare<br>
They love it more than bread.</p>
<p><em>Chorus</em></p>
<p>John Barleycorn's to the hangman gone<br>
And the reason I'll unfold:<br>
For robbing honest English folk<br>

<p>(by Iolo fitz Owen, mka David R. Watson)<br>
The baron of Eastmarch's fair sorcerous daughter<br>
Was enamoured unseemly with the fool of her lord<br>
Though her duke was deemed handsome he'd a soul vain and petty<br>
And a dark mind as empty as last summer's gourd<br>
And the fool he was clever and he sang for the lady<br>
Like a nightingale piping in a deep forest grove<br>
But his station was lowly and his body was aging<br>
Their love was as hopeless as if he were stone<br>
So the lady has led them, the fool and her husband,<br>
To her cool secret garden by the midsummer's moon<br>
And she's danced them a spell there of shifting and changing<br>
And left them dumbfounded by sorcery's boon<br>
She has left the fool crying to the gods of his fathers<br>
She has led her duke laughing to her high chamber door<br>
And she's kept him there softly for three days' bright dawnings<br>
While her servants all gossip in wonder and awe<br>
Now the fool died in madness saying he was ensorcelled<br>
 And the duke only smiled him a sad secret smile<br>
Now the duke rules his people with wit and good humour<br>
And sings for the lady like the nightingale's song<br>
She has borne him five children, two sons and three daughters<br>
They've grown straight and handsome and sorcerous all<br>
And they dance in the garden and sing in the moonlight<br>
Like nightingales piping in a green forest hall</p>

<p>(by Peter and Steve Jones)<br>
Kilkelly, Ireland, eighteen-and-sixty, my dear and loving son John,<br>
Your good friend the schoolmaster Pat McNamara's so good as to write these words down<br>
Your brothers have all gone to find work in England; the house is so empty and sad.<br>
The crop of potatoes is sorely infected - a third to a half of them bad.<br>
And your sister Bridget and Patrick O'Donnell are going to be married in June<br>
Your mother says not to work on the railroad and be sure to come on home soon<br>
Kilkelly, Ireland, eighteen-and-seventy, dear and loving son John,<br>
Hello to your missus and to your four children, may they grow healthy and strong.<br>
Michael has got in a wee bit of trouble. I suppose that he never will learn.<br>
Because of the dampness there's no turf to speak of, and now we have nothing to burn.<br>
But Bridget is happy you named the child for her. You know she has six of her own?<br>
You say you found work but you don't say what kind or when you'll be coming home.<br>
Kilkelly, Ireland, eighteen-and-eighty, dear John and Michael, my sons,<br>
I'm sorry to give you the very sad news that your dear old mother passed on.<br>
We buried her down at the church in Kilkelly; your brothers and Bridget were there.<br>
You don't have to worry, she died very quickly. Remember her in your prayers.<br>
But it's so good to hear that Michael's returning. With money he's sure to buy land;<br>
The crop is still poor and the people are selling at any price that they can.<br>
Kilkelly, Ireland, eighteen-and-ninety, my dear and loving son John,<br>
I suppose I must be close on to eighty; it's thirty years since you've gone.<br>
But because of all of the money you send me I'm still living out on my own.<br>
Michael has built himself a fine house and Bridget's daughters are grown.<br>
And thank you for sending your family picture. They're lovely young women and men.<br>
You say you might even come home for a visit - what joy to see you again!<br>
Kilkelly, Ireland, eighteen-and-ninety-two, My dear brother John,<br>
I'm sorry I didn't write sooner to tell you that Father passed on.<br>
He was living with Bridget, she says he was happy and cheerful right down to the end.<br>
You should have seen him playing with the grandchildren of Pat McNamara, your friend.<br>
And we buried him alongside of Mother Down at the Kilkelly churchyard.<br>
He was a strong and a feisty old man considering his life was so hard.<br>
And it's funny, the way he kept talking about you. He called for you, at the end.<br>
Oh, why don't you think about coming to visit. We'd all love to see you again.</p>

<p>(words by Ken and Lisa Theriot; music traditional)<br>
There lived a king into the east,<br>
Yearly greens the grove<br>
There lived a lady in the west.<br>
Where the hart goes yearly<br>
It fell about a May morning<br>
When gone a-hunting was the King</p>

<p>Out a-maying went the Queen<br>
She's lain beneath the hawthorn green</p>

<p>She woke and screamed and tore her gown<br>
And in her bower they've laid her down</p>

<p>The King said, "Tell me what you've seen<br>
Out beneath the hawthorn green."</p>

<p>"A strange voice calling in my sleep<br>
Said, 'Soon you will be mine to keep'</p>

<p>The King of Faerie comes for me<br>
Tomorrow noon by that same tree."</p>

<p>King Orfeo said, "This I'll do<br>
One hundred knights will ride with you</p>

<p>And if your fears are proven real<br>
The fairy King shall meet our steel."</p>

<p>But it was as the lady feared<br>
Despite her guard, she disappeared</p>

<p>In grief, the King took off his crown<br>
In beggar's clothes he left the town</p>

<p>He played his harp to ease his pain<br>
And ten years thus he did remain</p>

<p>Some ladies came a-hunting by<br>
His Queen among them caught his eye</p>

<p>He chased and spared not stub nor stem<br>
To castle's gate he followed them</p>

<p>He played his harp for castle's guard<br>
And so gained entry as a bard</p>

<p>And passing he did see his Queen<br>
Asleep beneath a hawthorn green</p>

<p>Now he's gone on into the hall<br>
And played his harp among them all</p>

<p>He's harped the bird down from the sky<br>
He's harped a tear from every eye</p>

<p>The fairy King said, "Name thy fee,<br>
"Ask anything, I'll give it thee!"</p>

<p>"Sir, grant me only that lady<br>
That sleeps beneath the hawthorn tree."</p>

<p>The King said, "You are rough and mean<br>
And she is fair as any Queen</p>

<p>And what a foul thing it would be<br>
To see her in thy company."</p>

<p>"A fouler thing, so I have heard<br>
Is a King who breaks his given word."</p>

<p>The King, who knew the words were true,<br>
Said, "Take her then away with you."</p>

<p>Then Orfeo he glad arose<br>
And he's cast off his beggar's clothes</p>

<p>He's brought his Queen back to the town<br>
And taken up again his crown</p>

<p>He ruled in faith his fellow men<br>
And ne'er saw fairy folk again.</p>

A lusty young smith at his vice stood a-filing.<br>
His hammer laid by but his forge still aglow.<br>
When to him a buxom young damsel came smiling,<br>
And asked if to work in her forge he would go.<br>
With a jingle, bang, jingle, bang, jingle,<br>
With a jingle, bang, jingle, bang, jingle, high-ho!<br>
"I will," said the smith, and they went off together,<br>
Along to the young damsel's forge they did go.<br>
They stripped to go to it; 'twas hot work and hot weather.<br>
They kindled a fire and she soon made him glow.</p>
<p><em>Chorus</em></p>
<p>Her husband, she said, no good work could afford her.<br>
His strength and his tools were worn out long ago.<br>
The smith said "Well mine are in very good order,<br>
And I am now ready my skill for to show."</p>

<p>Red hot grew his iron, as both did desire,<br>
And he was too wise not to strike while 'twas so.<br>

<p>Six times did his iron, by vigorous heating,<br>

If ever thou gav'st silver or gold,<br>
At t' Brig o' Dread thou'lt find foothold,<br>
But if silver or gold thou never gav'st nane,<br>

From Brig o' Dread whence thou may'st pass,<br>
To Purgatory fire thou com'st at last;<br>
If ever thou gav'st meat or drink,<br>

If meat or drink thou ne'er gav'st nane,<br>
The fire will burn thee to the bare bane;<br>
This ae nighte, this ae nighte,<br>
Fire and fleet and candle-lighte,</p>

An old man came courting me<br>
Hey ding-durum dow<br>
An old man came courting me<br>
Me being young<br>
An old man came courting me<br>
Said he would marry me<br>
Maids when you're young never wed an old man<br>
 For he's got no fa-lurum, fa-fiddle, da-lurum<br>
 He's got no fa-lurum, fa-fiddle, fa-lay<br>
He's go no fa-lurum, he's lost his ding-durum<br>
 Maid's when you're young never wed an old man!</p>

<p>When we did go to church<br>
He left me in the lurch<br>
 Chorus</p>

<p>When we did go to bed<br>
He lay like he was dead</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>So I threw my leg over him<br>
Damn well near smothered him<br>
 Chorus</p>

<p>When he lay fast asleep<br>
From his bed I did creep<br>
Into the arms of a handsome young man<br>
 And he's got fa-lorum, fa-fiddle, da-lorum<br>
Yes he's got fa-lorum, fa-fiddle, fa-lay<br>
Yes he's got fa-lorum, I found his ding-dorum<br>
Maids when you're young never wed an old man!</p>

<p>I've armored up a thousand times<br>
for country and for king<br>
And many's the tale that I could tell<br>
or song that I could sing.<br>
I've fought in Beltane's driving rain<br>
And struggled for each breath<br>
At salt wars and Oleno where<br>
We damn near froze to death<br>
I've had my share of bruises and<br>
I've watched the arrows fly<br>
But the strangest thing that I've ever seen<br>
Was the man who would not die<br>
He stood a towering seven feet<br>
A giant among'st men<br>
His armour was of twelve guage steel<br>
His hide it was of ten<br>
From a land most far away he came<br>
Their champion and King<br>
And many crafty ways he had<br>
To make your helmet ring<br>
The battle lines they soon were joined<br>
And much to my surprise<br>
I was locked in single combat with<br>
The man who wouldn't die<br>
We circled round a time or two<br>
Then I opened up the show<br>
With an underhanded wrist shot which<br>
Is still my favorite blow<br>
He didn't even try to block<br>
Just brought that greatsword down<br>
And split my helm completely from<br>
The chin up to the crown<br>
And though my sword was still entrapped<br>
In the dent made in his side<br>
"What a mighty knight" his people cheered<br>
"Is the man who wouldn't die"<br>
Full four and twenty fighters fell<br>
Before his awesome might<br>
And though many blows did land it seems<br>
That every one was light<br>
The battle soon was over and<br>
By God's own blood he went<br>
Off to the sides to doff his gear<br>
And hammer out the dent's<br>
The second battle soon began<br>
And I took another try<br>
Bearing a sword named "Rhino's Bane"<br>
For the Man who would not die<br>
For "Rhino's Bane" was a special blade<br>
Immortal for those who know<br>
And if he had not felt those blows<br>
He'd Damn Well Feel One Now!<br>
Three feet of rattan I center drilled<br>
Then hollowed out the head<br>
And filled that hole with six or maybe<br>
seven pounds of lead<br>
A single shot was all I'd get<br>
I raised that sword on high<br>
And buried it within the helm<br>
of the man who would not die<br>
He didn't even bat an eye<br>
Just calmly struck me down<br>
And then went on the clear the field<br>
Of squires, Knights and Crown<br>
I pondered why this man was not<br>
A'stretched out on the dirt<br>
I guess a head shot does no good<br>
with nothing there to hurt<br>
The third engagement was delayed<br>
To give the chiurgeon's time<br>
To pry the sword from out the head<br>
Of the man who would not die<br>
A battle deep within the woods<br>
Was the last fight of the day<br>
And the men remaining on my side<br>
Went on their knees to pray<br>
"Oh Lord, If you care for us<br>
Allow your moon to fall<br>
Upon this man for that would be<br>
The only blow he'd call"<br>
But as we marched atop a hill<br>
A plan occurred which I<br>
Thought maybe could lead to the death<br>
of the man who would not die<br>
Upon the hill there lay a stone<br>
A full six feet in girth<br>
"Oh gather round my fighters bold<br>
We'll bring this man to earth!"<br>
Ten stalwart lads I need with me to<br>
Strike the final blow<br>
While the rest shall keep behemoth here<br>
occupied below<br>
And when he tries to fight you<br>
From up above will fly<br>
This boulder full upon the frame<br>
Of the man who would not die<br>
It happened just as I forsaw<br>
From out the woods he ran<br>
And stopped there right below us as<br>
According to the plan<br>
The men below fought bravely while<br>
The men above did strain<br>
To send that boulder from the hill<br>
Onto his alleged brain<br>
At last the stone it stirred to life<br>
And with a final pry<br>
We sent that boulder on it's way<br>
To the man who wouldn't die<br>
Knocking trees to left and right<br>
That fearsome missile sped<br>
And with a final bounce it came<br>
To rest upon his head<br>
His arms and legs were all that we<br>
Could see beneath the stone<br>
But when we came from atop the hill<br>
We heard our victim groan<br>
Astounded round him 'bout we stood<br>
As the day bled into night<br>
And heard him say one final time<br>
"My lords, that blow was light!"</p>

<p>Well, I've got a little lass and her name is Mary Mack<br>
Make no mistake, she's the one I'm goin' to take<br>
A lot of other fellows would get up upon her track<br>
But I'm thinkin' that they'd have to get up early<br>
Oh, Mary Mack's mother's makin' Mary Mack marry me<br>
My mother's makin' me marry Mary Mack<br>
I'm goin' to marry Mary to get Mary to take care of me<br>
We'll all be makin' merry when I marry Mary Mack.<br>
Now, Mary and her mother go an awful lot together<br>
In fact, you never see the one nor one without the other<br>
And all the fellows wonder if it's Mary or her mother<br>
Or the both of them together that I'm courtin'.<br>
Now, this little lass, she's got a lot of class,<br>
She's got a lot of brass and her father thinks I'm flash<br>
I'd be a silly ass if I let the matter pass<br>
For her father thinks I suit her very fairly.<br>
Now, the wedding day's on Wednesday and everything's arranged<br>
Her name'll soon be changed to mine unless her mind is changed<br>
I'm makin' the arrangements, I'm just about deranged<br>
For a wedding is an awful undertaking'.<br>
It's sure to be a grand affair and grander than a faire<br>
There's gonna be a coach and pair for pair that's there<br>
We'll dine upon the finest fare, I'm sure to get my share<br>
If I don't I'm sure I'm very much mistaken.</p>

In Dublin's fair city,<br>
Where the girls are so pretty,<br>
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone,<br>
As she wheeled her wheel-barrow,<br>
Through streets broad and narrow,<br>
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh!"<br>
"Alive, alive, oh,<br>
Alive, alive, oh",<br>
Crying "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh".<br>
She was a fishmonger,<br>
But sure 'twas no wonder,<br>
For so were her father and mother before,<br>
And they each wheeled their barrow,<br>
Through streets broad and narrow,<br>
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh!"</p>

<p>She died of a fever<br>
And no one could save her<br>

<div><p><a id="Mighty-Casey"><h2 class="song">Mighty Casey</h2></a></p>

<p>(lyrics by Edmound Bernhard, adapted from Ernest Lawrence Thayer)<br>
The field was terribly vicious<br>
For the tourney list that day<br>
A Baby Knight from Ansteorra<br>
Seemed poised to have his way<br>
So when Jago was one-shotted<br>
And Bertrond had lost both arms<br>
A mood of deep depression<br>
Fell over the Outlands Charms<br>
The lesser fighters bereft of lives<br>
Made way back to the camp<br>
But the older Outlands fighters<br>
Would stay to see the champ<br>
They said "If only Casey<br>
Had had a chance to fight<br>
We'd have a chance to win our luck<br>
Against this Rhino-Hide<br>
Then suddenly their eyes lit up<br>
A cry rose from their Lords<br>
It echoed off the polearms<br>
It rattled off the swords<br>
It rumbled through the valley<br>
Where Outlandish fighters healed<br>
For Casey, Mighty Casey<br>
Was about to take the field<br>
His helm was brightly shining<br>
His leathers richly tanned<br>
His breastplate layered titanium<br>
(Which cost him half a grand)<br>
The shield upon his mighty arm<br>
Was golden from afar<br>
Between his teeth he coolly clenched<br>
A really good cigar<br>
The Outlands fighters now revived<br>
Together in one light<br>
Would cheer the mighty Casey on<br>
In this, his greatest fight<br>
There was ease in Casey's manner<br>
As his new opponent met<br>
His hands were steady as a rock<br>
His brow was free of sweat<br>
"One quick blow" he murmured<br>
As he looked up to the sky<br>
Then bowing only to his Queen<br>
He launched into the fight<br>
The cool is drained from Casey's face<br>
His eyes are hard and keen<br>
And all along his sun-drenched brow<br>
Great furrows can be seen<br>
And now he calmly grips his sword<br>
And now he makes his throw<br>
And Now The Air Is SHATTERED<br>
By the force of Casey's blow<br>
Oh somewhere in the Knowne Worlde<br>
There is a Happy Place<br>
Where Gentle Lords and Ladies<br>
Lie oblivious in their grace<br>
But there is no joy in the Outlands<br>
Upon this sultry night<br>
For the foe of Mighty Casey<br>
Has called his great blow "Light"</p>

Hail be to they of the Forest Gentry<br>
Pale, dark spirits, help us free<br>
White is the dust of the state of dreaming<br>
Light is the mixture to make one still<br>
Dark is the powder of Death's redeeming<br>
Mark that but one pinch can kill<br>
Sleep<br>
Poison in your dreams<br>
Some will not awake<br>
Nothing's as it seems<br>
Iron bonds will break<br>
Hearts will be set free<br>

I am my mother's savage daughter,<br>
the one who runs barefoot cursing sharp stones.<br>
I am my mother's savage daughter,<br>
I will not cut my hair, I will not lower my voice.<br>
My mother's wild child is a savage,<br>
She looks for her omens in the colors of stones,<br>
In the faces of cats, in the fall of feathers,<br>
In the dancing of fire and the cracks of old bones.</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>My mothers child dances in darkness,<br>
And sings heathen songs by the light of the moon,<br>
And watches the stars and renames the planets,<br>
And dreams she can reach them with a song and a broom.</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>Now my mother's child curses too loud and too often,<br>
My mother's child laughs too hard and too long,<br>
And howls at the moon and sleeps in ditches,<br>
And constantly raises her voice in this song.</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>Now we all are brought forth out of darkness and water,<br>
Brought into this world through blood and through pain,<br>
And deep in our bones, the old songs are wakened,<br>
So sing them with voices of fervor and pain.<br>
We are our mother's savage daughters,<br>
The ones who run barefoot cursing sharp stones.<br>
We are our mother's savage daughters,<br>
We will not cut our hair, we will not lower our voice.</p>

<p>I, a tender young Maid, have been courted by many,<br>
Of all sorts and Trades as ever was any:<br>
A spruce Haberdasher first spake me fair<br>
But I would have nothing to do with Small ware.<br>
My Thing is my Own, and I'll keep it so still,<br>
Yet other young Lasses may do what they will.<br>
My Thing is my Own, and I'll keep it so still,<br>
Yet other young Lasses may do what they will.</p>

<p>A sweet scented Courtier did give me a kiss,<br>
And promis'd me Mountains if I would be his,<br>
But I'll not believe him, for it is too true,<br>
Some Courtiers do promise much more than they do.<br>
 Chorus </p>

<p>A Master of Musick came with an intent,<br>
To give me a Lesson on my Instrument,<br>
I thank'd him for nothing, but bid him be gone,<br>
For my little Fiddle should not be plaid on.<br>
 Chorus </p>

<p>An Usurer came with abundance of Cash,<br>
But I had no mind to come under his Lash<br>
He profer'd me Jewels, and a great store of Gold,<br>
But I would not mortgage my little Free-hold.<br>
 Chorus <br>
A blunt Lieutenant surprized my Placket<br>
And fiercely began to rifle and sack it,<br>
I mustered my Spirits up and became bold,<br>
And forc'd my lieutenant to quit his strong hold.<br>
 Chorus <br>
A fine dapper Tailor, with a Yard in his Hand,<br>
Did profer his Service to be at Command,<br>
He talk'd of a slit I had above the knee,<br>
But I'll have no Taylors to stitch it for me.<br>
 Chorus <br>
A fine Man of Law did come out of the Strand,<br>
To plead his own case with his fee in his hand;<br>
He made a brave motion but that would not do,<br>
For I did dismiss him and nonsuit him too.<br>
 Chorus </p>

<p>Next came a young fellow, a notable spark,<br>
(With green bag and inkhorn, a Justice's clerk)<br>
He pull'd out his warrant to make all appear,<br>
But I sent him away with a flea in his ear.<br>
 Chorus </p>

<p>A crafty young bumpkin that was very rich,<br>
And us'd with his bargains to go thro' stitch,<br>
Did tender a sum, but it would not avail,<br>
That I should admit him my tenant in tayl.<br>
 Chorus </p>

<p>A Gentleman that did talk much of his grounds<br>
His Horses, his Setting-Dogs, and his greyhounds<br>
Put in for a Course, and us'd all his art<br>
But he mist of the Sport, for Puss would not start<br>
 Chorus </p>

<p>A pretty young Squire new come to the town<br>
To empty his Pockets, and so to go down,<br>
Did profer a kindness, but I would have none<br>
The same that he us'd to his mother's maid, Joan.<br>
 Chorus </p>

<p>Now here I could reckon a hundred and more<br>
Besides all the Gamesters recited before<br>
That made their addresses in hopes of a snap<br>
But as young as I was I understood trap.<br>
 My thing is my own, and I'll keep it so still<br>
 Until I be marryed, say men what they will.</p>

<p>(by Harry Wincott, with additions by Elena Churilov)<br>
Some friends and I in a public house<br>
Were playing dominoes one night<br>
When into the room the barman came<br>
His face all a chalky white.<br>
"What's up", says Brown, "Have you seen a ghost?<br>
Have you seen your Aunt Mariah?"<br>
"Oh me Aunt Mariah be buggered!", says he,<br>
"The bloody pub's on fire!"<br>
"On fire?" says Brown, "What a bit of luck.<br>
Everybody follow me.<br>
It's down to the cellar<br>
If the fire's not there<br>
We'll have a rare old spree."<br>
So we all went down after good old Brown<br>
The booze we could not miss<br>
And we hadn't been there five minutes or more<br>
Till we were all half pissed.<br>
And there was Brown upside down<br>
Lickin' up the whiskey on the floor.<br>
"Booze, booze!" The firemen cried<br>
As they came knockin' on the door<br>
Don't let 'em in till it's all drunk up<br>
Somebody shouted, “MacIntyre!”<br>
And we all got blue-blind paralytic drunk<br>
When the Old Dun Cow caught fire.<br>
Then, Smith walked over to the port wine tub<br>
And gave it a few hard knocks<br>
Started takin' off his pantaloons<br>
Likewise his shoes and socks.<br>
"Hold on, " says Brown, "we can't have that<br>
Ye can't do that in here.<br>
Don't go washin' yer trotters in the good port wine<br>
When we've got all this Lite beer."</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>Just then from through the pub's back door<br>
Came the Vicar of the local church<br>
And when he saw our drunken ways,<br>
He began to scream and curse.<br>
"Ah, you foolish sods! You heathen clods!<br>
You've taken to a drunken spree!<br>
You've gone and drunk all the Benedictine wine<br>
And you didn't leave none for me!"</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>And then there came an awful crash<br>
As half the bloody roof gave way.<br>
We were drowned in the firemen's hose<br>
But we were goin' ta stay.<br>
So we got some tacks and our own wet slacks<br>
And we nailed ourselves inside<br>
And we sat there swallyin' pints o' stout<br>
Till we were bleary-eyed.</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>Hours later when the fire was out<br>
We dragged ourselves out from below<br>
Our pub was burned, our booze was drunk,<br>
Our heads were hanging low.<br>
"Oh heck", says Brown with with a worried frown<br>
Some thought had made him glower<br>
"Now we better get moving down to Murphy's Pub,<br>
It'll close in just an hour!"</p>

<p>Oh it is the biggest mix-up that you have ever seen<br>
My father he was Orange, and me Mother she was Green<br>
Oh my father was an Ulsterman, proud Protestant was he<br>
My mother was a Catholic girl, from County Cork came she<br>
They were married in two churches, lived happily enough<br>
Until the day that I was born, Then things got rather tough</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>Baptized by Father Iley, I was rushed away by car<br>
To be made a little Orangeman, me fathers shinin' star<br>
And I was christened David Anthony, but still in spite of that<br>
To my father I was William, while my mother called me Pat</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>With mother every Sunday to Mass I'd proudly stroll<br>
Then after that the Orange Lodge would try to save my soul<br>
Though both sides tried to claim me, but I was smart because<br>
I'd play the flute, or play the harp, dependin' where I was</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>One day me Ma's relations came round to visit me<br>
Just ask my fathers kinfolk, we're all sittin' down to tea<br>
We tried to smooth things over, but they began to fight<br>
An' me bein' strictly neutral, I hit everyone in sight</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>Now my parents never could agree about my childhood school<br>
My learnin' was all done at home that's why I'm such a fool<br>
They've both passed on, God rest 'em, but left me caught between<br>
That awful color problem of the Orange and the Green</p>

Am - G Em Am - - -<br>
G - - Em Am - - -<br>
C - - G Em - - -<br>
Am - - G Am - - -<br>
Far over the Misty Mountains cold,<br>
To dungeons deep and caverns old,<br>
We must away, ere break of day,<br>
To seek our pale enchanted gold.<br>
The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,<br>
While hammers fell like ringing bells,<br>
In places deep, where dark things sleep,<br>
In hollow halls beneath the fells.<br>
For ancient king and elvish lord<br>
There many a gleaming golden hoard<br>
They shaped and wrought, and light they caught,<br>
To hide in gems on hilt of sword.<br>
Goblets they carved there for themselves,<br>
And harps of gold, where no man delves<br>
There lay they long, and many a song<br>
Was sung unheard by men or elves.<br>
Far over the Misty Mountains cold,<br>
To dungeons deep and caverns old,<br>
We must away, ere break of day,<br>
To claim our long-forgotten gold.<br>
The pines were roaring on the heights,<br>
The wind was moaning in the night,<br>
The fire was red, it flaming spread,<br>
The trees like torches blazed with light.<br>
The bells were ringing in the dale,<br>
And men looked up with faces pale.<br>
The dragon's ire, more fierce than fire,<br>
Laid low their towers and houses frail.<br>
The mountain smoked beneath the moon.<br>
The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.<br>
They fled the hall to dying fall<br>
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.<br>
Far over the Misty Mountains grim,<br>
To dungeons deep and caverns dim,<br>
We must away, ere break of day,<br>
To win our harps and gold from him!<br>
Under the Mountain dark and tall,<br>
The King has come unto his hall!<br>
His foe is dead, the Worm of Dread,<br>
And ever so his foes shall fall!<br>
The sword is sharp, the spear is long,<br>
The arrow swift, the Gate is strong.<br>
The heart is bold that looks on gold;<br>
The dwarves no more shall suffer wrong.<br>
The mountain throne once more is freed!<br>
O! Wandering folk, the summons heed!<br>
Come haste! Come haste! Across the waste!<br>
The king of friend and kin has need.<br>
Now call we over the mountains cold,<br>
'Come back unto the caverns old!'<br>
Here at the gates the king awaits,<br>
His hands are rich with gems and gold.</p>

<p>(lyrics by Edward Lear, music by Elizabeth Hummel)<br>
The Owl and the Pussy-cat went to sea<br>
 In a beautiful pea green boat,<br>
They took some honey, and plenty of money,<br>
 Wrapped up in a five pound note.<br>
The Owl looked up to the stars above,<br>
 And sang to a small guitar,<br>
'O lovely Pussy! O Pussy my love,<br>
 What a beautiful Pussy you are,<br>
 You are!<br>
What a beautiful Pussy you are!'<br>
Pussy said to the Owl, 'You elegant fowl!<br>
 How charmingly sweet you sing!<br>
O let us be married! too long we have tarried:<br>
 But what shall we do for a ring?'<br>
They sailed away, for a year and a day,<br>
 To the land where the Bong-tree grows<br>
And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood<br>
 With a ring at the end of his nose,<br>
 His nose,<br>
With a ring at the end of his nose.<br>
'Dear pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling<br>
 Your ring?' Said the Piggy, 'I will.'<br>
So they took it away, and were married next day<br>
 By the Turkey who lives on the hill.<br>
They dined on mince, and slices of quince,<br>
 Which they ate with a runcible spoon;<br>
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,<br>
 They danced by the light of the moon,<br>
 The moon,<br>
They danced by the light of the moon</p>

Of all the money that e'er I had<br>
I spent it in good company<br>
And all the harm that e'er I've done<br>
Alas! it was to none but me<br>
And all I've done for want of wit<br>
To mem'ry now I'll not recall<br>
So fill to me the parting glass<br>
Good night and joy be with you all<br>
 So fill to me the parting glass<br>
 And drink a health, whate'er befalls<br>
 And gently rise and softly call<br>
 Goodnight, and joy be to you all<br>
Oh, all the comrades that e'er I had<br>
They're sorry for my going away<br>
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had<br>
They'd wish me one more day to stay<br>
But since it falls unto my lot<br>

<p>Oh, pass the bottle ‘round to me; I'll pass it back again<br>
For beer and whiskey tend to make the happiest of friends<br>
There comes a time in all our lives near the ending of our years<br>
Where we will go to part this world and never more be here<br>
But ‘till then our friends we'll wait with you and have you gather round<br>
And lots of whiskey ale and brew we'll happily drink down</p>

<p>The Japanese have sake; the Frenchmen wine in drums<br>
The Germans have their kegs of beer, and pirates they drink rum<br>
But we drink juice of the barley with water from a spring<br>
It makes us feel so light and cheerful as we start to sing</p>
<p><em>Chorus</em></p>
<p>Now Nate he was a friend of ours, worked at the whiskey mill<br>
One fateful day into a vat he sadly took a spill<br>
He fended off our efforts when to save him we all tried<br>
And drank his fill nine times around ‘til happily he died</p>

<p>We pulled Nate out and took him to the local great mortician<br>
Who sadly said he's gone my boy's I'll take him for cremation<br>
But Nates body had been in so long the whisky marinade<br>
When they put him on the pyre to burn him in the fire he burned for 8 days straight!</p>

<div><p><a id="The-Priestess-and-the-Warrior"><h2 class="song">The Priestess and the Warrior</h2></a></p>

<p> (by Lucien de Pontivy mka Myra Hope Eskridge)<br>
One summer night, on the Wessex road, two travelers were met.<br>
The one, aswarm in thoughts. The other, struggling to forget.<br>
Behold: a warrior's tale is ended, this tale is begun,<br>
as one priestess finds true magic and the other finds her son.<br>
For me, I galloped lightly, undelayed by any load.<br>
Up ahead I saw a traveler's back a-plodding down the road.<br>
His rusted armor gleamed in spots - was that a dagger's edge?<br>
One leap, and my good horse could find the safety of the hedge.<br>
He heard me not, but turned to count the miles that he had gained.<br>
His weary gaze met mine, and then he turned his back again.<br>
Emboldened by my robes, I cried, "Warrior, let me by!"<br>
and not a word said he, yet drew aside as I came nigh.<br>
An hour on, I'd forgotten him, and stopped to make up camp.<br>
By nightfall, all the woodlands heard his tired horse's stamp.<br>
Ere he could pass, I cried out, "Rider, rest here on your course!<br>
Come share the fire, if not for you, then pity for your horse."<br>
He stopped, and reeled - from hunger or exhaustion I know not -<br>
but tried and failed to bring the weary horse back to a trot.<br>
The mare won; with a sigh the battered traveler dropped to ground.<br>
I eyed his tattered things and wrapped my linens close around.<br>
Silent sat we both, my eyes on him, his on the flame.<br>
My anger flared; he'd offered neither greeting, thanks, nor name.<br>
"Your armor smells of blood," I said, "it stains the forest floor."<br>
His eyes raised. "You're a priestess," he replied, and said no more.<br>
I cast a hand of bark shards to the flames, to make them spark.<br>
The scent of apple-blossoms filled the air and lit the dark.<br>
Then magic crackled 'round my robes as spells of warding spoke.<br>
I saw it now - a greater danger in the warrior's cloak.<br>
His eyes were blue like mine, his hair as gold as new-cut flax,<br>
but this man was no Celtic lord; he bore a straight blade Sax.<br>
"Saxon man!" I said aloud, and startled him from rest.<br>
"This is no road for you; what prize awaits you in the west?"<br>
"None that I've earned," he snapped, then he would not meet my eyes.<br>
He swallowed hard, and said "Nor none that my return would prize."<br>
I looked away, and in the darkness wrestled my unrest.<br>
The silence grew. The warrior clutched a sadness in his chest.<br>
"Tell me your tale?" I asked him then - how his shoulders shook.<br>
A stranger's touch, a softly spoken word, was all it took.<br>
"My father is a Saxon chief - or was," the warrior told.<br>
"He took my from my village, made me iron-strong and bold."<br>
"I grew to manhood fighting, first with fists and then with blade.<br>
My father ached with pride to the the man that he had made."<br>
"Then the border wars called all. Long years we fought and gave our best,<br>
'til the day the howling Scotsmen fought like wolverines possessed."<br>
"The stench of blood and iron, their cries of triumph fill my head.<br>
My brothers all are gone and I alone survive the dead."<br>
"And look at me - a Saxon man as surely as I live -<br>
and yet, a Celt by blood, and that no family could forgive."<br>
"I wish that I'd been butchered with my father on the field,<br>
for none at home will welcome me, except upon my shield."<br>
The flood of words had ended, left his eyes too tired to weep.<br>
With silent art I touched his dreams and eased his mind in sleep.<br>
The twittering night drew close - I cast my gaze upon the moon.<br>
By morning, I had slept, but sunlight woke us both too soon.<br>
We packed and rode in silence, but I dwelled within my thoughts -<br>
of battle-rage, and prejudice, and the blood we both had wrought.<br>
I looked. He seemed more peaceful now, our horses keeping stride,<br>
but still his eyes betrayed a question he held back from pride.<br>
The next breeze brought the scent of apple-blossoms, and I knew.<br>
"In the vale beyond this ridge," I said, "your mother waits for you."<br>
His startled glance knew hope, and proved my intuition right.<br>
He cried the mare to speed and raced to greet the coming night<br>
By evening we had claimed the ridge and looked out out on a vale<br>
as misty-green by twilight as in memory and tale.<br>
A mounted host approached, all leather-clad, no rank nor line,<br>
with one rider in linen robes as heather-blue as mine.<br>
Maeve of elder-light drew close, her hood around her face.<br>
The warrior fell down to the earth and cried aloud for grace.<br>
Maeve alit, from awesome height she gazed down through the years,<br>
drew back her hood and showed her face as wet as his with tears<br>
And great Maeve bent down and touched the man upon the head.<br>
"Rise up my son," said she, "and dwell no more among the dead."<br>
A cheer rang out as all around us welcomed the man home.<br>
His kinsman circled round and bade him stay and never roam.<br>
Then gazed Maeve of elder-light on me, of everyone.<br>
At last, she spoke: "Thank you," she said, "for bringing home my son."<br>
One summer night on the Wessex road, two travelers were met.<br>
The one, aswarm in thoughts. The other, struggling to forget.<br>
Behold: a warrior's tale is ended, another tale begun,<br>
as one priestess finds true magic, and the other finds her son.</p>

<p>(by Andy Stewart)<br>
Gentlemen, it is my duty to inform you of one beauty<br>
Though I'd ask of you a favor, not to seek her for a while<br>
I own she is a creature of character and feature<br>
No words can paint the picture of the Queen of all Argyll!<br>
And if you could have seen her there!<br>
Boys, if you had just been there!<br>
The swan was in her movement and the morning in her smile<br>
All the roses in the garden they bow and ask her pardon<br>
For not one could match the beauty of the Queen of all Argyll!<br>
On the evening that I mentioned, I passed with light intention<br>
Through a part of our dear country known for beauty and for style<br>
Bein' a place of noble thinkers, of scholars and great drinkers<br>
But above them all for splendor shone the Queen of all Argyll!</p>
<p><em>Chorus</em></p>
<p>So, m'lads I needs must leave you, my intention's no to grieve you<br>
Nor indeed would I deceive you, no, I'll see you in a while<br>
I must find some way to gain her, to court her and to tame her<br>
I fear my heart's in danger from the Queen of all Argyll!</p>

But gie me a ramblin' rover,<br>
And fae Orkney down to Dover.<br>
We will roam the country over<br>
And together we'll face the world.<br>
There's many that feign enjoyment<br>
From merciless employment,<br>
Their ambition was this deployment<br>
From the minute they left the school.<br>
And they save and scrape and ponder<br>
While the rest go out and squander,<br>
See the world and rove and wander<br>
And are happier as a rule.</p>

<p>(lyrics by Malkin Gray, music by Peregrynne Windrider)<br>
Sigurd, the jarl of the Orkney Isles, has called to his banner a viking band,<br>
And sailed to Dublin to make himself King of the Irish land.<br>
But crowns are never so quickly won, the Norns, they well know—<br>
The king of the Irish blocks our way. We must to battle go.<br>
The raven banner of the Orkney jarl brings luck in battle, but its bearer dies.<br>
Two men have fallen 'neath its wings today, but still the raven flies.<br>
The jarl tells a third to take it up. The third man answers no.<br>
"The devil's your own, take it up yourself, and back to battle go."<br>
"'Tis fitting the beggar should bear the bag," replies the jarl, "And I'll do so here."<br>
He fought with the banner tied around his waist and fell to an Irish spear.<br>
He died and the Irish broke our line. We had no chance but flight.<br>
But I'm not hurried - - it's a long way home; I won't get there tonight.<br>
The Norns have woven a bloody web, tapestry woven of guts and bone,<br>
And parcelled it out to the Orkney host - - our day in Ireland's done.<br>
The grey wolf howls and the ravens soar above the arrow's flight,<br>
And Odin is waiting beyond the fray for some of us tonight.</p>

We're losing money!<br>
Why won't our chickens lay eggs?”<br>
One day a rooster came into our yard<br>
And caught our little chickens right off their guard.<br>
They're laying eggs now, just like they used to,<br>
Ever since that rooster came into our yard.<br>
Repeat for:<br>
We had a milkcow, no milk would she give<br>
We're getting eggnog in nice white cartons<br>
We had a gumtree, no gum would it bear<br>
We're getting chiclets in five fruit flavors<br>
We had a beanstalk, no beans would it grow<br>
We're getting chickpeas chock full of protein<br>
I had a wife, no child would she bear<br>
We've got an egghead, his name is Melvin<br>
We had a rooster, he was flamingly gay<br>
Once day a chicken came into our yard<br>
He's laying hens now, like he never useta<br>
Ever since that chicken came into our yard!</p>

Oh Maggie Rue has nut-brown curls<br>
And a twinkle in her eye<br>
And Maggie Rue has a hand-made book<br>
Of a hundred ways to die<br>
Oh Rue's a lovely little flower<br>
But keep your hands away<br>
The slightest touch won't burn you much<br>
Any more, and you'll rue the day<br>
Oh Maggie Rue has a steady hand<br>
With her craft and with her art<br>
And Maggie Rue has a twisted spike<br>
She can throw and pierce your heart</p>

<p>Oh Maggie Rue has a way with plants<br>
And tends her garden well<br>
And Maggie Rue has a bitter tea<br>
That will send you straight to hell</p>

You can hear clear 'cross the room<br>

Tell her to wash it in yonder dry well<br>

Where ne'er a drop of water e'er fell<br>
Then she'll be a true love of mine<br>
Tell her to find me an acre of land,<br>

Between the salt water and the sea strand,<br>
Then she'll be a true love of mine.<br>
Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather,<br>

<p>(Lyrics by Malkin Gray, music by Peregrynne Windrider)<br>
Hasten, O sea-steed, over the swan-road,<br>
Foamy-necked ship o'er the froth of the sea!<br>
Hengest has called us from Gotland and Frisia<br>
To Vortigern's country, his army to be.<br>
We'll take our pay there in sweeter than silver,<br>
We'll take our plunder in richer than gold,<br>
For Hengest has promised us land for our fighting,<br>
Land for the sons of the Saxons to hold!<br>
Hasten, O fyrds-men, down to the river;<br>
The dragon ships come on the in-flowing tide.<br>
The linden-wood shield and the old spear of ash-wood<br>
Are needed again by the cold waterside.<br>
Draw up the shield-wall, O shoulder-companions;<br>
Later, whenever our story is told,<br>
They'll say that we died guarding what we call dearest,<br>
Land that the sons of the Saxons will hold!<br>
Hasten, O house-carls, north to the Danelaw;<br>
Harald Hardrada's come over the sea!<br>
His longships he's laden with baresarks from Norway<br>
To claim Canute's crown and our master to be.<br>
Bitter he'll find here the bite of our spear-points,<br>
Hard ruling Northmen too strong to die old.<br>
We'll grant him six feet - - plus as much as he's taller - -<br>
Of land that the sons of the Saxons will hold!<br>
Make haste, son of Godwin, southward from Stamford,<br>
Victory's sweet and your men have fought hard,<br>
But William the Bastard has landed at Pevensey,<br>
Burning the land you have promised to guard.<br>
Draw up the spears on the hill-top at Hastings,<br>
Fight till the sun drops and evening grows cold,<br>
And die with the last of your Saxons around you,<br>
Holding the land you were given to hold!</p>

<p> (by Alexander James Adams, pka Heather Alexander)<br>
Way, hey, listen to me play<br>
Won't you throw but a shilling,<br>
Or a copper, my way?<br>
Tales of life, love, sorrow and joy<br>
Are the songs that are sung<br>
By the stable boy<br>
Well, I dream of the life<br>
Of a bard on the road,<br>
Yet, the wages they pay<br>
Would scarcely feed the load<br>
So with hoe in my hand<br>
And with rake at my side<br>
I would care after horses<br>
For the ladies to ride</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>Well, the farmer, he calls me<br>
Into his big home, saying,<br>
"Pretty stable boy,<br>
On the road you now must roam<br>
"Though you do fine work,<br>
I admit that is true,<br>
I have found me a man<br>
Who will work for half as you!"</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>Well, I woke the next morning<br>
The sky was bright blue<br>
And the farmer, he said,<br>
"There's a favor you must do.<br>
"I've a gathering of orphans<br>
With nowhere to be,<br>
You must teach them to ride<br>
So that they can work for me!"</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>Well, we work every morning<br>
And ride every day<br>
We muck out the stalls<br>
And we feed the horses hay<br>
We're such excellent workers,<br>
The foremen believes<br>
I could own this estate<br>
With my band of little thieves<br>

<p>One morn, for recreation, as I strayed by the sea-side<br>
The sun was gently rising, bedeck'd in all his pride,<br>
I beheld a lovely maiden sitting at a cottage door<br>
With roses blooming on her cheeks, Sweet Jenny of the Moor!<br>
Stood in contemplation as I view'd each charming scene<br>
And fill'd with admiration, as if in some fairy dream;<br>
Enchanted by this fair one as she walked along the shore.<br>
Gathering of choice sea-weeds, was Sweet Jenny of the Moor!<br>
Said I, "My pretty fair one, why so early do you rise?"<br>
"I love to breathe the morning air, when the lark soars in the skies,<br>
This spot is sweet to wander by, tho' the breakers often roar<br>
And wakes the bosom of the deep," says Sweet Jenny of the Moor!<br>
We both sat down together, by a pleasant shady side,<br>
I said, " My dear, with your consent, I'll make you my bride,<br>
I've plenty at my own command, brought from a foreign shore<br>
For, proud's the man that wins the hand of Sweet Jenny of the Moor!<br>
"I have a true-love of my own, tho' long he's been away,<br>
And true I'll be to him while he is on the sea<br>
His vows were fondly spoken when we parted at the door,<br>
I will wait 'till his return," says Sweet Jenny of the Moor!<br>
"Oh, if your love he is a sailor, pray, tell me now his name!"<br>
"His name is Dennis Ryan, from Newry town he came,<br>
With laurels I'll entwine him, when he returns on shore.<br>
We'll join our hands in wedlock's bands," says Sweet Jenny of the Moor!<br>
"If Dennis was your own true-love, I knew him very well,<br>
Whilst fighting at the Alma, by an angry ball he fell ;<br>
Behold this true-love token, which upon his hand he wore.”<br>
She fell and fainted in his arms Sweet Jenny, of the Moor!<br>
"Since you have proved so kind and true, look up, my love I cried,<br>
Behold, it is your Dennis, now standing by your side,<br>
Let us be united, and live happy on this shore,<br>
The bells shall merrily ring my love; I'll go to sea no more.</p>

<p><em>I forbid ye maidens all<br>
who let fly your lovely hair<br>
to go down to Carterhaugh<br>
for young Tam Lin is there</em></p>

<p>Janet tied her kirtle green<br>
above her knee and not below<br>
and she's gone to carterhaugh<br>
just as fast as she can go</p>

<p>She's come to the roses growing wild<br>
she's pulled a single one<br>
when a wild young man appears<br>
and cries 'O, lady, let alone!</p>

<p>'How dare you pull my roses out,<br>
How dare you break my tree<br>
How dare you run in these green woods<br>
Without asking leave of me?'</p>

<p>Says Janet fair 'this wood's my own<br>
My father gave it me<br>
And I can pluck myself a rose<br>
Without asking leave of thee.'</p>

<p>Bold as brass, he takes her hand<br>
and color rises to her skin<br>
She looks the young man in the eye<br>
and knows him now for young Tam Lin.</p>

<p><em>Refrain</em></p>

<p>Janet holds her petticoats<br>
well above her dirty knee<br>
and she's gone to her father's hall<br>
just as fast as she can hie.</p>

<p>All the ladies of the court<br>
at their play turn red as rose<br>
except for Janet, fainting fast,<br>
green as growing grass she goes</p>

<p>Out then speaks her father dear,<br>
doting, caring, meek and mild.<br>
'Janet, darling daughter mine,<br>
I fear you go with child.'</p>

<p>'Father, if I be with child,<br>
be sure myself shall bear the blame.<br>
There's not a knight within your hall<br>
shall get the baby's name.</p>

<p>Father, if I be with child,<br>
'twill prove a wondrous birth<br>
for well I swear it's not the get<br>
of any mortal man on earth.'</p>

<p><em>Refrain</em></p>

<p>Janet's tied her kirtle green<br>
When near nine months are gone<br>
And she's away to Carterhaugh,<br>
To speak with young Tam Lin.</p>

<p>But young Tam Lin will not be found<br>
and Janet's in despair<br>
to the forest floor she falls<br>
and swift her lover catches her</p>

<p>Janet asks 'Tam Lin, my love, <br>
why is it in these woods you hide?'<br>
'The queen of faeries stole me hence,<br>
alas, when I was but a child.</p>

<p>'My lordly sire was a skillful man<br>
and hunting he loved well<br>
but I was prey for the faerie Queen<br>
when from my horse I fell.</p>

<p>'Ever since, in yon green hill,<br>
with the Queen I'm bound to dwell<br>
I'd never tire of living there<br>
for Faerie does me well</p>

<p>'But at the end of seven years,<br>
the queen doth pay a tithe to hell<br>
I am so fair and full of flesh,<br>
I fear 'twill be myself.'</p>

<p><em>Refrain</em></p>

<p>Tonight's the night of Halloween,<br>
and the fairy court will ride;<br>
And she that would her true love win<br>
at Miles Cross must bide.</p>

<p>'But how shall I thee ken, Tam-lin?<br>
Or how shall I thee know?<br>
Amang a troupe of faerie knights,<br>
The like I never saw?'</p>

<p>'First let pass the horses black<br>
then let pass the brown<br>
Run ye to the milk white steed<br>
and pull that rider down.</p>

<p>'They will change me in your arms<br>
into a deadly adder<br>
but hold me fast and fear me not<br>
I am the baby's father</p>

<p>'They will change me in your arms<br>
into a bear or lion bold<br>
but hold me fast and fear me not<br>
I am the father of your child</p>

<p>'At last they'll change me in your arms<br>
into a naked knight.<br>
Then cast your mantle over me<br>
and keep me out of sight.'</p>

<p><em>Refrain</em></p>

<p>Gloomy, gloomy, was the night,<br>
And eery was the way,<br>
As Janet in her mantle green<br>
To Miles Cross did hie.</p>

<p>The heavens dressed in baleful black<br>
and all was silent as the grave,<br>
But Janet waited in the dark<br>
Her own true love to save.</p>

<p>Betwixt the hour of twelve and one,<br>
the north wind blew and tore and rent<br>
she heard the elfin bridles ring<br>
upon the wind where e'er it went</p>

<p>Janet stood, with mind unmoved,<br>
The gloomy heath upon,<br>
And louder, louder rang the bells,<br>
As the fairy court came riding on.</p>

<p>And first rode by the night black steeds<br>
and then went by the brown;<br>
then up she ran to the charger pale<br>
and pulled her lover down.</p>

<p>They changed him in her arms to all<br>
the beasts and flames and hateful things,<br>
but she did all that her lover bade<br>
and young Tam Lin she won.</p>

<p>Up then spoke the Faery Queen<br>
An angry queen was she.<br>
'Woe betide the wretch who's ta'en<br>
the best knight of Our company.</p>

<p>'Had I but known, Tam-Lin, she said<br>
What defeat this night I'd see<br>
I'd've stolen both thine eyes<br>
and changed thee fast into a tree.</p>

<p>'Had I but known, Tam-lin, she said<br>
before we left this night to roam,<br>
I'd've et thy heart of flesh<br>
and left thee with a heart of stone!'</p>

<p><em>Refrain</em></p>

<p>Janet tied her kirtle green<br>
above her knee and not below<br>
and she's off to Carterhaugh<br>
as fast as love can go.</p>

<p>Uncle Rat went out to ride<br>
Kitty alone, kitty alone<br>
Uncle Rat went out to ride<br>
Kitty alone and I<br>
Uncle Rat went out to ride<br>
Sword and buckle by his side<br>
Macax macari duck and a dil<br>
Kitty alone and I<br>
Lady Mouse, will ye marry me?<br>
Ask my Uncle Rat, says she<br>
Uncle Rat, will you marry Lady Mouse?<br>
Yes, kind sir, and half my house<br>
Lady Mouse, where will the wedding be?<br>
Ask my Uncle Rat, says she<br>
Uncle Rat, where will the wedding be?<br>
Up at the top of a holly tree</p>

<p>Cold blows the wind over my true love<br>
Cold blow the drops of rain<br>
I never had but one true love<br>
And in Camville he was slain<br>
I'll do as much for my true love<br>
As any young girl may<br>
I'll sit and weep down by his grave<br>
For twelve months and one day<br>
But when twelve months were come and gone<br>
This young man he arose<br>
What makes you weep down by my grave<br>
I can't take my repose<br>
One kiss, one kiss of your lily white lips<br>
One kiss is all I crave<br>
One kiss, one kiss of your lily white lips<br>
And return back to your grave<br>
My lips they are as cold as clay<br>
My breath is heavy and strong<br>
If thou were to kiss my lily white lips<br>
Thy days would not be long<br>
Go fetch me a nut from a dungeon deep<br>
And water from a stone<br>
And white milk from a maiden's breast<br>
That babe has never known<br>
Go dig me a grave both long, wide and deep<br>
As quickly as you may<br>
I'll lie down in it and take my sleep<br>
For twelve months and one day<br>
Oh don't you remember the garden grove<br>
Where we used to walk<br>
Pluck the finest flower of them all<br>
Twill wither to a stalk<br>
The stalk is withered dry, my love,<br>
So will our hearts decay;<br>
So make yourself content, my love,<br>
Till Death calls you away.<br>
Cold blows the wind over my true love<br>
Cold blow the drops of rain<br>
I never had but one true love<br>
And in Camville he was slain<br>
I'll do as much for my true love<br>
As any young girl may<br>
I'll sit and weep down by his grave<br>
For twelve months and one day</p>

<div><p><a id="The-Veil"><h2 class="song">The Veil</h2>
(by Garraed Galbraith, mka Tim Jennings, 2005)</p>

<p>At the age of sixteen I crossed the wide ocean<br>
To take arms and stand 'neath the flag of my king<br>
And there on my belt hung the veil of a lady<br>
Still salted with tears and the promise they bring</p>

<p><em>She said come back to me<br>
Though the whole world you travel<br>
Win through each day and do honour for me<br>
And let every vic'try you claim be a token<br>
Return to my arms, your true love I will be</em></p>

<p>For six months or longer I journeyed to find them<br>
An army assembled, like nothing I'd seen<br>
Ten thousand men stood by the banks of the river<br>
With armour of sunlight and swords battle keen</p>

I joined in the ranks of a stalwart battalion<br>
My captain stood shoulder to shoulder with me<br>
Though he fell, I fought through. Her veil as my armour<br>
And for her in battle, I claimed victory</p>
<p><em>Chorus</em></p>
<p>Promotion was mine through both luck and attrition<br>
The King made me captain, a knight soon to be<br>
If I could but win him the city we cordoned.<br>
I won it for him, but t'was her victory.<br>
A decade passed by in the blink of an instant<br>
A full 'knight commander' bestowed upon me<br>
My company rode 'neath the high Kings own banner<br>
Above it the favour of my own lady</p>
<p><em>Chorus</em></p>
<p>And then the wars ended, and we journeyed homeward<br>
Estates now were in mine in five countries and more<br>
That rag on my belt was a thousand times mended<br>
I came home to her, to forget about war<br>
She stood in her doorway, as if she were waiting<br>
Her sons nine and seven. A daughter of three<br>
She smil'd as she stared at me, trying to remember<br>
The boy and the veil and her promise to me</p>
<p><em>Chorus</em></p>
<p>I left her bewildered, with gifts for her children<br>
Her eyes had changed colour in ten years it seems<br>
For hers were the grey of a mother and housewife<br>
And not the blue ocean I held in my dreams<br>
I joined then my King, as he rode forth to battle<br>
To fight a new war in some land o'er the sea<br>
He asked of my lady and of the worn favour<br>
and smiled as I told him of her words to me</p>
<p><em>Chorus</em></p>
<p>So now we return to the battle and bloodshed<br>
My men call her name, as we join in the fray<br>
I'll see her forever through veils of my dreaming<br>
And still it's for her I will win through this day</p>
<p><em>Chorus</em></p>
<p>That girl in my dreams is still waiting for me!!!</p>

<div><p><a id="Whiskey-in-the-Jar"><h2 class="song">Whiskey in the Jar</h2></a></p>

<p>As I was going over the far famed Kerry mountains<br>
I met with captain Farrell and his money he was counting.<br>
I first produced my pistol, and then produced my rapier.<br>
Said stand and deliver, or the Devil, he may take ya'</p>

<p><em>Mush a ring from a doery eye<br>
Whack for me daddy, oh<br>
Whack for me daddy, oh<br>
There's whiskey in the jar</em></p>

I counted out his money, and it made a pretty penny.<br>
I put it in my pocket and I took it home to Jenny.<br>
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me,<br>
but the devil take that woman, for she never can be easy</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>I went into my chamber; it was time to take my slumber,<br>
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure it was no wonder.<br>
But Jenny took my charges and she filled them up with water,<br>
Then sent for captain Farrel to be ready for the slaughter.</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>Then early in the morning, right before I rose to travel,<br>
A band of footmen at the door and likewise captain Farrel.<br>
I first produced my pistol, for Jenny stole my rapier,<br>
But I couldn't shoot for water so a prisoner I was taken.</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>If anyone can aid me, it's my brother in the army,<br>
If I can find his station down in Cork or in Killarney.<br>
And if he'll come and save me, we'll go roving near Kilkenny,<br>
And I know he'll treat me better than me old mispoken Jenny</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>Now some men take delight in the carriages a-rollin',<br>
And others take delight in the haulin' of the bowline.<br>
But me I take delight in the juice of the barley,<br>
And courting pretty maidens in the morning bright and early</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<div><p><a id="The-Widow-and-the-Devil"><h2 class="song">The Widow and the Devil</h2></a></p>

<p>High atop a lonely moor, a Widow lived alone.<br>
Well, in she kept, and as she slept,<br>
her pillow heard her moan:<br>
"Oh, many's the lonely traveller<br>
has spent the night with me,<br>
but there's not a man in all creation<br>
gives content to me!</p>

<p>"Well, some can manage once or twice,<br>
and some make three or four;<br>
but it seems to me a rarity<br>
is the man who can do more.<br>
I'd do anything to find him,<br>
in Heaven or in Hell."<br>
And as she spoke these words,<br>
sure, she heard her front door bell.</p>

<p><em>And the wind blew cold and lonely<br>
across that Widow's moor,<br>
and she never, ever turned away<br>
a traveller from the door.</em></p>

<p>So boldly ran the Widow,<br>
and the door did open wide,<br>
and as she did, a tall and handsome<br>
stranger stepped inside.<br>
Well, she gave him bread and brandy,<br>
and when that he was fed,<br>
he said, "My dear, now have no fear;<br>
it's time to come to bed.</p>

<p>"For I've heard your plea<br>
right down the lane,<br>
and I've come to see you right.<br>
But you must come to Hell with me<br>
if I can last the night."<br>
Well, she said, "You randy Devil!<br>
To this bargain I'll agree,<br>
for Hell on Earth, or Hell in Hell,<br>
it's all the same to me!"</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>Now, as they tumbled into bed,<br>
the Devil, he proved well...<br>
and he thought before the night would end<br>
that she'd be in his Hell.<br>
Ah, but when they came to number nine,<br>
the Widow cried out, "More!"<br>
And when the twelfth time came around,<br>
the Widow cried, "Encore!"</p>

<p>At twenty-five the Devil<br>
felt compelled to take a rest,<br>
but the Widow cried,<br>
"Come raise your head,<br>
and put me to the test!"<br>
At sixty-nine, the Widow laughed.<br>
"Again! Again!" she cried,<br>
and the Devil said, "Well, I can see<br>
just how your husband died!"</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>At ninety-nine, the Devil<br>
he began to wail and weep.<br>
He said, "I'll give you anything,<br>
if you'll let me go to sleep!"<br>
But before the morning light was up,<br>
the Devil hobbled home,<br>
and the Widow, still not satisfied,<br>
once more was left alone.</p>

<p>She lay there on her pillow<br>
and she thought on ninety-nine.<br>
"It's a pity that poor old Devil<br>
couldn't manage one more time!<br>
I'll call him up again tonight<br>
to see what can be done -<br>
with a little more application,<br>
he could've made the ton!"</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>But when she called to him that night,<br>
no Devil did appear.<br>
For the first time in Eternity,<br>
the Devil, he shook with fear.<br>
He said, "Of all the torments<br>
I've witnessed here in Hell,<br>
I never knew what pain was,<br>
'til I rang your front door bell!"</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>John was not an evil man<br>
Though far from perfect true<br>
And he spent his days a rovin' though<br>
He'd a wife and daughter too<br>
He staggered home one drunken night<br>
And paused beneath an oak<br>
To warm himself and rest a while<br>
He'd move on when he woke<br>
And though he'd built a fire to ward<br>
Off the evenin' chill<br>
The embers slowly died from sight<br>
The woods grew cold and still<br>
John awoke to a huntsman's horn<br>
And the bayin' of some hound<br>
I've stumbled in just before the morn'<br>
To some noble's hunting ground<br>
He saw the hound all pallid white<br>
With ears a bloody red<br>
And then he saw the Huntsman<br>
And John was filled with dread<br>
Run for your life, John<br>
The Wild Hunts comin'<br>
Comin' after thee<br>
Run for your life, John<br>
The hounds are callin'<br>
Callin' out to thee<br>
Take to the hills<br>
Take to the woods<br>
Hie through the brambles and see<br>
If you can't outrun them<br>
Until the morning<br>
See if you can't get free<br>
Well over hill through forest too<br>
Through stream and thorny briar<br>
The Huntsman and his hounds kept chasing<br>
Never would they tire<br>
And John he knew if he could last<br>
Until the mornin' light<br>
Why he would have outrun them<br>
And made it through the night<br>
But it was yet some hours until<br>
He'd see the mornin' sun<br>
And then he heard the hounds again<br>
This chase had just begun</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>John made it back unto his home<br>
And saw an awful sight<br>
For it was all abandoned<br>
O'ergrown in just one night<br>
‘Full twenty years have come and gone<br>
since all me drunken days.<br>
If I knew then what I know now<br>
I'd've changed my rovin' ways'<br>
The Huntsman gave a soulless laugh<br>
John cried, “By all good men<br>
I'll never let ya have me!”<br>
And the chase began again</p>

<p><em>Chorus</em></p>

<p>And if you're there some moonlit night<br>
When the woods grow cold and chill<br>
Why you'll see John the rover<br>
They say he runs there still<br>
Chorus x2<br>
Run for your life John<br>
The Wild Hunt's comin'!</p>

And the trees sae sweetly blooming<br>

I've been a wild rover for many's the year<br>
And I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer<br>
And now I'm returning with gold in great store<br>
And I never will play the wild rover no more<br>
 And it's no, nay, never - No, nay, never, no more,<br>
 Will I play the wild rover -No, never, no more<br>
I went to an alehouse I used to frequent<br>
And I told the landlady my money was spent<br>
When I asked her for credit, well she answered me "Nay<br>
Such custom as yours I can get any day”</p>
<p><em>Chorus</em></p>
<p>She said “With all of the credit that you swore you'd pay back<br>
I could spend all my savings and not feel the lack<br>
Oh, if you paid off just half of what you owe to me<br>
I'd sell whiskey for pennies and my ale would be free!”</p>
<p><em>Chorus</em></p>
<p>So then I took from my pocket a handful of gold<br>
And on the round table it glittered and rolled<br>
Well, the landlady smiled as she served me the best<br>
“What I told you before sure ‘twas only in jest!”</p>
<p><em>Chorus</em></p>
<p>I'll go back to my parents, confess what I've done<br>
And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son<br>
And when they'll forgive me as oftimes before<br>
Then I swear I will play the wild rover no more</p>
