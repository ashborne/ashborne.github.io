psychology
	sex for me is very much about immersing myself in my senses
		i will almost certainly become nonverbal
			in this state i can still understand and respond to questions that can be answered nonverbally (such as yes/no questions)
			PLEASE do not feel like just because i'm not talking, you can't or shouldn't. talking is good, asking questions is good
			i can also fingerspell slowly, so if you know how to read fingerspelling that's cool
			i can also type if i have an appropriate device nearby, but that's usually pretty inconvenient
			i will get my words back eventually
				it is easier to respond to specific prompts than to generate words spontaneously
				ramping down intensity of sensation will help me get my words back sooner
					conversely continuing with stimulation will prolong wordlessness
				i like to do debriefing sessions once i get my words back
					anything that was particularly good/bad
					clarifying any curiosity/confusion
		i will almost certainly become very light-sensitive
			unless it is pretty dim, i will probably keep my eyes closed most of the time
			if you see me covering my eyes, closing them is not helping enough and i would probably appreciate you turning out/dimming the lights, blindfolding me, or otherwise making the bright less painful
		things that draw my attention to my sensory experience are good
			sensual touch like stroking my face or limbs, or petting my hair, or massage
			lightly drawing my attention to an area before you do more intense stuff to it helps me process it and immerse myself better
				lightly rubbing/stroking/patting an area before spanking/slapping/grabbing/scratching it
				kissing a part of me before biting it
				running your fingers through my hair before pulling on it
				idly/gently moving my head around before shoving it somewhere
			i am very add and if i am understimulated my mind will probably start wandering and probably not to sexy things
				the more i can immerse myself in the moment and in sensation/the more i can shut off my mind, the more into it i am able to be
				stimulus that is too constant is easy to acclimate to and forget about
				being left alone without stimulation for too long will lead to me getting distracted
	i am very subby
		this primarily means i prefer not to be the one making decisions/in control
		it also means i like to feel useful/helpful
			i like to have firm direction
				clear, actionable instructions
					i will get flustered if given an instruction that i have difficulty acting on (this is leverageable)
				i tend to feel awkward and incompetent if it's not clear what i should be doing
				i am generally bored/frustrated by partners who can't/don't/won't tell me what they like/want
					i try to mentally frame it as "yay, a mystery to ~explore~" but like in practice it frequently leads to "uh, is this even doing anything? how about this? warmer? colder? come on i need to at least know what direction to look in :/"
					come to think of it surprisingly few people i've fucked have known what they wanted or really been able to give clear feedback
					and when they do i often only end up with one or two things that "work" and then feel like i've gotten stuck in a script of mechanically pressing the same buttons in the same order
					so maybe what i need to be happier topping/domming is just partners who are way more self-aware/knowledgeable/expressive about their sexual response?
					or perhaps to learn to feel more okay doing things even when i'm not confident i'm doing them well
			i like to have reliable evidence that my service is appreciated
				i am very gratified by clear, immediate, specific feedback
					wordsing about your appreciation is good
					noising about your appreciation also good
					emoting good iff i can actually see you doing it
					if what i am doing is neutral-to-negative please tell me immediately
						preferably with instructions on how to improve if at all possible
				i will get bored/anxious/antsy doing something for a long time without any reinforcement
				i don't particularly enjoy punishment
					if the reward structure is laid out beforehand and i actually feel like the punishment is fair and avoidable then it's okay
					being punished for things i have no control over, could not have predicted, or anything else that feels abitrary is not a good time
					i'm generally happier when punishment is not in the picture at all though
		i do not enjoy misrepresenting my desires and will generally do my best to make them clear
			not being able to speak is a hindrance, but i usually manage
				if i seem frustrated or like i want to communicate something complicated, ASK QUESTIONS
				seriously you can get a lot of good information from a series of well-designed yes/no questions
				get me my phone or something else to type/write with if it's really an issue
			if i had a safeword it would probably be "hold", but in practice words are hard
			if i do not like what's going on, i'm usually also pretty clear about that - moving away, making ow noises, grabbing your hand and making it not do the thing, etc
			being stymied in my desires is fine, though i have a limit to how frustrated i can tolerate getting (limit is correlated to how much faith i have that my desires will eventually be fulfilled)
			being flustered/embarrassed by my desires is good
				also tends to shut down words FAST
			roleplaying stuff is hard to pull off but has worked in the past. i have a hard time getting into character.
				all the times it has worked it has been either while i am already in character for a LARP or immediately after an intense character-building session or both
		body language and dirty talking that reinforce the power dynamic = very yay
			tossing me around or otherwise moving me how you want me is good
				especially my head - controlling my head movements is a very effective way to reinforce the dynamic
			imperious, intense, threatening looks are good, esp w/ evil grins/smirks
			calling me stuff is good, but expecting me to use titles is not really going to work because it requires words
				reinforcement stuff like "good girl" causes cuddly-warm-fuzzies; degradation stuff like "on your fucking knees, whore" causes shocky-shivery-wetness; both reinforce power dynamics
				probably avoid calling me negative stuff though, especially "slut", because reasons (this can possibly be poked at but carefully and like talk to me about it before you do)
					reasons are basically that 2nd boyfriend and i had a dynamic where i called him Sir and he called me slut and it was very warm/fuzzy and cute
					but then during/after we broke up he did a bunch of shitty stuff including calling me and subsequent girlfriend a lot of bad names, slut among them
					and now i have a lot of Conflicted Emotions over being called slut
						because like my first instinct is "eeee yay being called things that are normally considered bad but in a way that makes it clear that aspect of me is valued! validating AND hot!"
						and then that gets tied up and smothered by the part of me that is like "people saying this don't REALLY mean the word the way they are pretending to and they actually think Bad Things about you"
						so depending on tone of voice and like how coherent i am during the sex and level of trust etc it could be like really affirming and help me Get Over Shit
						or it could be an emotional punch to the gut and make me Very Upset
							which could be hot? but would need Hella Aftercare and like negotiation beforehand and etc (like i have only cried during sex a couple times and never on purpose and i’m kinda interested in trying to make it happen on purpose but would need the circumstances to be very carefully engineered)
								cried #1: the first time my ex girlfriend used a crop on me, i was in a really emotionally tense space in my life and also she was really good at reading me and knowing what to do with that and how how hard/how much to do it? so like she slowly went from lightly cropping me all over to harder and harder on places that could take it to really hard directly on my vulva. and i went from like gasping to laughing to crying and it was super awesome and remains one of my favorite sex memories.
								cried #2: one time i was rubbing my clit while being fisted and then got a case of Gender Feels and started crying and was like “huh why am i crying? is this good crying?” and took a while to realize that i was crying because like, i didn’t have a cock and for some reason the particular sensations i was having kinda rubbed that in in a bad way? it’s only ever happened the once and i’ve done that activity a lot, so i donno what that was about
								i would like to repeat the first experience. i would not like to repeat the second. i would be curious to try a scene that relies a bit more heavily on inflicting psychological/emotional pain than on physical pain with the aim of making me cry
	i prefer to bottom
		i like being penetrated a *lot*
			more on this under specific orifice headings below, but suffice to say that stretchy-fullness feeling is really good and hits my kinks
			"a lot" here is intentionally ambiguous and means pretty much all the obvious interpretations
		i tend to feel kindof flaily and uncoordinated when i have to be in the active role
		understimulation leads to my mind wandering and me getting bored and topping tends to be understimulating for me
			there seems to be some degree of workaround for this if i am getting a lot of encouragement/reinforcement in the form of shiny faces/noises/words?
			i primarily enjoy sex by falling into myself/immersing myself in the sensations, and it's hard to do that while also paying attention and checking in with someone else
			i can get *satisfaction* from inducing fun-to-watch reactions in another person but it doesn't really get me off and i've never been able to maintain them reacting interestingly enough to hold my attention for very long
	i am into bondage
		i like to be able to pull against restraints
			when restraining me please consider how i'm going to be pulling on the restraints
				have the primary vector of tension in opposition to the primary muscle group i would use to pull
				have things symmetrical (so that eg both of my arms are using the same muscles to pull)
		ropes/cuffs and collar are my usual go-to
			i have not tried fancy rope things and want to
					i have so far been better with rope than everyone who has tried to tie me up and it is very frustrating
		my ulnar nerve is unusually likely to start going numb
			this basically means be careful about anything that puts pressure on the back/outside of my arms
			ask me to show you the innervation pattern if you're curious (or just google in yourself)
		being immobilized is also fun 
			i usually use stretch wrap for this - it's like plastic wrap but made to wrap bigger stuff
            semi-relevant story:
				so a little over a year ago i volunteered at this kink con so that i could get in at a much reduced price. at this kink convention there was this play room with lots of cool equipment available for general use (like suspension rigs and sex sling frams and st andrews crosses and a barrel you could bend people over and etc etc). in one corner there was this super cool device i was eyeing all weekend. it was sortof like a motorized hamster wheel with a stretcher suspended inside it? (i think it was originally some sort of medical equipment for like spinal decompression therapy or something.)
				anyway finally on the last day of the con after ogling it all weekend my girlfriend and i noticed it was free (or uh, maybe we camped it out >_>) and descended upon it. there was stretch wrap provided next to the thing and so i got on the stretcher part and she wrapped me up such that i was pretty well stuck to the thing and couldn’t move at all. and i think blindfolded me too because i don’t remember being able to see anything?? but then she had fun turning it to various odd angles and hitting me with the toys we had brought and i honestly am not even sure what she did it is mostly just a blur of like wheeeeeeeeeee in my memory
				anyway i still have no idea what that thing is called and i want to know so i can Repeat The Experience (though probably it will just be there at the con again if i go this year??)
		being pinned or held down is good too
		basically i like to be relieved of the need to pay conscious attention to my body movement/positioning
	i am a masochist
		how much pain is good vs bad scales with arousal
			pain is good
			overstimulation is bad
			pain can be overstimulatey if it is too intense
		impact is good
			thuddy somewhat preferred over stingy
			butt, thighs, boobs, shoulders, upper back, vulva are all spots that have worked well
			riding crop, flogger, heavy rubber paddle, and hand are my preferred implements so far
			light/gentle touch on places sensitized by impact is v good
		sensation play is good even if not strictly pain
			temperature (ice/wax), prickles (pinwheel), scratching (fingernails, pins, etc), and pressure (gripping/squeezing) are all good
			i am curious about electric stuff and chemical stuff (menthol, capsaicin, ginger, etc) but don't have much experience
		biting is good to a point
		grabbing can be good but you are probably hurting me more than you think you are with it so be careful
		pain based on being in awkward positions is meh
		i have a history of self-harm/cutting, so anything that cuts/pierces the skin or simulates that is probably to be handled with care?
	i kink on cum
		i really like the idea of being filled *in general*, but *especially* with cum
		cumming in/on me is ideal
		cum that is not in/on me is sad
		i will probably want to lick it all up or rub it all over myself or both
		riffing on impregnation stuff is probably a plus?
	my sexuality is mostly reactive/responsive
		i will probably not be the one to initiate sex most of the time
			i do have times of spontaneous arousal though and may be more initiatey during them
			during spontaneous arousal i am likely to be obviously horny even if not more initiatey
			i think it has to do with hormone cycles? i'm still getting used to my IUD so this is unclear
			i am usually pretty open to trying sex even if i don't feel that horny, and will just focus on getting you off if i don't start feeling it
			my willingness to initiate sex seems to be strongly affected by:
				-hormones (i’m usually horniest right before my period)
				-my partner’s typical initiative (if they typically initiate, i’m more willing to wait for them to do it even when i’m considering initiating)
				-availability of partner (if they are naked and snuggling me i am more likely to initiate)
				-social repercussions (if i think someone might be upset i am less likely to initiate)
				-partner’s skill (if they are good at fucking me i will be more likely to initiate)
				-my partner’s emotional state wrt sex (if they have a lot of insecurity/anxiety attached to sex i will be less inclined to initiate)
				-my partner’s emotional connection with me (if they feel secure and comfortable in their relationship with me i will be more inclined to initiate)
				-if there is some specific activity in mind that i’m excited about, i am more likely to initiate
				it’s pretty much a straightforward tradeoff between expected stress and expected pleasure, but this is not always obvious from the inside, and it can be difficult for me to tell the difference between “just not sexually interested” and “chronic mild stressor disproportionately impacting my interest levels”.
				though, now that i am in multiple relationships at the same time it’s a little easier to see “oh hey i am much more initiatey with person A than with person B, i bet it’s because with person A i have [encouraging factors] while with person B i have [inhibiting factors]”
		things that sometimes work to elicit sexy responses from me:
			ramping up any of the other headers under 'psychology', or any of the less intense stuff in the other top-level headers
				soft touch/stroking, massage, kissing, hair petting, subtle kink stuff, viewing porn, etc
				giving oral gets me wet like nobody's business and i'm often up for it even if i don't feel horny
			being conspicuously horny/sexually available in my presence
				hard cock in particular is extremely shiny
					i will probably want to play with it and kiss/cuddle it and will have a hard time *not* doing that if at all with in reach >_>
					please do instruct on the proper handling of - for example i am still pretty unconfident about handjobs with circumcised cocks
				boobs are also shiny but less so
				butts are next on the shininess hierarchy probably
				putting any of those where i can see/grope/fondle/play with them will probably help your cause
					outright playing with them in front of me will can make me want to join in/help out
				literally fucking someone else where i can notice that this is happening seems to work also

mouth
	kissing is cool
		i'm not really sure what makes someone a good kisser?? like, i don't really think i am one?
		kissing that focuses on the lips is better than kissing that focuses on tongues
			tongues are kindof weird and gross
				licking the lips a little bit is okay
				i will not like it if you lick my face
				i will be kindof nonplussed if you put your tongue down my throat or even very far into my mouth probably
					it's not a negative but also not a positive; mostly i will just not know what to do with it
			lip sucking and biting are good though
		little all-over body kisses are fun to give and receive
	i really like giving oral, especially blowjobs
		combining this with head-control stuff (see below under the "neck" heading) is A+
			this can range from like "hand lightly on head while i mostly do my own thing" to "using my face like a fleshlight"
		blowjob experience can be approximated with phallic simulacra
		fingers in my mouth is good for kindof both of the reasons above
		i will pretty much keep blowing you until you tell me to stop
			not counting breaks to rest jaw/swallow saliva/stop gagging so much/catch breath/get that damn hair out of my mouth
				i *used* to be able to deep throat but i am sadly out of practice
			less true for eating people out but still somewhat true
			i will be *inclined* to keep going even after you cum but i understand that this is usually too much and will hold still/remove myself if necessary
		i will probably be very wet afterwards, especially if you cum in my mouth
	i tend to get moany/bitey/kissy at whatever is near my mouth
		this scales with how into things i am (i can get pretty loud)
		differences in moans/bites/kisses are informative and it is possible to learn to understand them
		i will default to pillowbiting if no part of you is available (or biting myself, if i am more readily available than bedding)

neck
	doing things with your mouth that are likely to hurt/leave a mark is generally good
		nibbling is good
		sucking is good
		biting is good
		licking is meh
			except on an area recently sensitized by biting to the point of bruise, then it is good
	choking is very good
		the goal here is mostly mild hypoxia due to restricted blood flow, plus psychological factors of someone other than me controlling that
		pressure around collarbone, under jaw, on sternecleomastoids, or on major blood vessels seem to be the way?
		pressure on like... the esophagus is not good
	leveraging my jaw to move my head is very good
	pulling on my hair is good (putting this in this section because nape of the neck things)
		grab by the fistful near to the scalp
		best to sortof, coming up from the neck, entwine your fingers loosely in the hair and then form a fist to grab?
		you want to be distributing the force of your pulling over as large an area of scalp as possible so that nothing tweaks and you don't pull out any hairs
		best leverage is achieved from the back/base of the skull, but sides of the head are also good
	taking those last few points together, controlling my head position/movements is yes

boobs/nipples
	squeezing/smooshing the boob as a whole is meh at best and uncomfortable at worst
		basically anything that really pokes into the fleshy part is kinda painful and not in the fun way
	if i am arching my back such that i am kindof thrusting my boobs at you i probably want you to play with my nipples
		squeezing the nipple itself is good
		also good: twisting, tweaking, pulling, twiddling, brushing
		gripping the areola or base of the nipple is probably the way to go; gripping the tip is usually too sharply painful
	nipple clamps are yay
		clip the areola, not the actual nipple part (like just the base of the nipple part)
		when removing clamps, hold the clippy part in place while loosening, then remove all at once like a bandaid, then apply pressure
	hands/clamps on nipples tend to be better than mouth
		this is usually because mouth is too soft/vague, so tongue/teeth stuff is probably better than eg sucking on the whole nipple
		mouth is extra good after pain though
	symmetry has a superadditive effect

vulva
	generally stroking lightly in this general area is a good way to gauge how turned on i am
		if i am not that turned on, it will feel nice and maybe help me get more turned on
		if i am that turned on, i will press into you and try to move so that your hand is positioned better to do the things i want
	clit
		be careful; it is easy to be too rough or otherwise overstimulate
			make sure you're not going in dry
				like, lick your finger or dip down and get some of my wetness or squirt some lube on or *something*
			don't go for it directly
				light stroking/petting or broad pressure in the general area first is good
				making me to come to you is a good idea
				on that note, if i'm pushing against you, staying still relative to yourself rather than me is a good idea - i'm probably trying to achieve something, and i won't be able to do that if you move with me
			START SLOW/GENTLE I AM SO SERIOUS
				MUCH better to start out lightly teasing and work up than to start out too hard
				slow means like... take positive integers of seconds to complete a stroke
				if i go eeeep/tense up/close my legs it is TOO MUCH and you should slooowwww downnnn
		it is probably easiest to find it by stroking up between the labia from the vaginal entrance (plus bonus of probably getting lubed up on the way)
		circles around the glans are probably my favorite stroke, followed by vertical ones between the frenulum and hood
			two fingers, one on either side, works pretty well
			if using tongue instead of fingers, go for "licking an ice cream cone" tongue pressure? (push with the blade of the tongue)
	vagina
		same as with clit, don't go in dry - keep playing around until i'm wet and trying to get you in me
			if i'm trying to get you in me but *not* wet then i'm probably just dehydrated or something. please grab the lube and go to town
			also keep in mind that sometimes the wetness is tucked away and you just need to stir a bit to find it
		when lubing up, whether it's with my wetness or with lube from a bottle, make sure that both me and whatever you're about to put in me are completely slick in all places we might come into contact
			usually rubbing whatever it is in a circular motion around the vaginal entrance is sufficient, but not always
			if you notice labia catching/pulling rather than sliding, that is not comfortable and the area that's catching needs to be lubed
		you can in fact fit your whole hand inside me, and i will probably like that
			make sure you work up to it though!
			(okay, i have not actually tested this with hands that are *very* much larger than mine. if you have very big hands, maybe not)
			also, often two fingers is sufficient. don't feel like you gotta just because you can
			in order to fit your hand in you will need to lube up properly
				do this by squeezing lube into your hand, then rubbing it all over and inside me
				if at any point your hand is sticking instead of sliding, there is insufficient lube at that point
				to ensure adequate lube coverage, don't just push inexorably forward, twist slightly or pull out and reinsert every so often
					basically the thing here is that you really need to get the lube on all of your hand and all places it might come in contact with on its path and that when something’s sticking it’s uncomfortable and the thing to do in that case is not to keep going but to change position so that you unstick and also get lube on wherever was sticking
			once you're in, you DO NOT need to do much at all
				light rhythmic pressure to the good spots
					there are some good spots - like, i donno, g spot or anterior fornix or etc? - and applying light rhythmic pressure to them correctly will make me come a lot
				light pulling outward or pressing inward
					like, fucking me, but with your fist, and slowly/gently because it’s your whole damn fist in there
				expanding your fist/pressing your fingers outwards
					stretchy-fullness is a good feeling and making your hand take up more volume creates that sensation and thus feels nice (but again there is possibility for too intense)
			if you can hit get my clit at the same time as hitting the good points inside me with your hand you can keep me cumming for a VERY long time
				like i've gone at least 20min before
				eating me out is probably the best but properly lubed fingers on clit can suffice
				if you can't get my clit then best to let me handle that part
		what feels good is primarily rhythmic pressure on the good spots, and stretchy-fullness
			expending a energy on in-out motions that don't actually press on those spots is a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing
			spots can be found
				along the anterior wall, nearish the cervix (feels firmish)
					this one is easy to hit with a cock or a dildo or even just a couple fingers
					if your penetration implement is in your crotch, missionary (esp with my legs up) or doggy style tend to hit it best; cowgirl *can* work but in practice rarely does
				along the sides (apparently feels snappy?)
					this one is harder to find? usually easiest to hit with fisting i think

butt stuff
	typical anal caveats of lots of lube, go slow, etc apply (ie, anal can be painful)
		to lay it out explicitly: 
			apply lube generously
			start with something small (like a finger)
			sloowly move in and out
			gradually work up to multiple fingers, keeping aware of things like knuckles and fingernails
			you can also use a tapered toy and fuck me with just the tip and slowly work more and more of it in
			angle of entry is very important!
			a good strategy is to have me do the movement until whatever it is is thoroughly in
			don't cross the streams (no fingers/toys on/in the vulva that have been in the butt)
			i tend to prefer using gloves/condoms for butt stuff (especially on toys; body parts are more negotiable)
	poop is awkward (ie, anal can be messy)
		i will feel embarrassed if my poop is noticeable, especially if it gets on you
			this can actually be used to good effect - enemas are humiliating in a way that can be really hot
		i will feel grossed out if your poop gets on me
			i don't typically get much out of being the penetrative partner, in general, though (see heading: i prefer to bottom)
				probably because understimulation leads to boredom/mindwandering/distraction
				so maybe this could be avoided you are likely to make shiny faces/noises
				or if otherwise it can be made more stimulating/attention-grabby
		workarounds include eg washing thoroughly, toys, gloves, condoms, being very blasé about it, getting me into subspace
	if these pitfalls are avoided i will find it really hot
		i can come from it but usually it's like, a super-teasy effect? ie it's often something very intense that makes me feel like i *should* be able to come but can't
		double penetration is super hot and i generally recommend it
			most easily accomplished with a toy in one hole and a you in the other
			toys in both works also though (theoretically so does person in both but this has yet to occur)
			toys have a tendency to come out (esp during orgasm) if nothing is actively holding them in
			make sure the things in each hole are small/squishy enough to interact well with each other (no one wants a fistula)
